VTAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKERS EXCHANGE RATE PLEA\u000a\u000aCentral bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. Reuter

VUNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986\u000a\u000aUnilever Plc UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.

VCHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.\u000a\u000aChina called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said. "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. Reuter

VKENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS\u000a\u000aThe Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year," he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added. "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development," he said. "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added. REUTER

VKODAK EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS\u000a\u000aEastman Kodak Co said it is introducing four information technology systems that will be led by today's highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval. The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of Kodak." Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company, Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent, that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out. The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector. Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today -- -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes). - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both. -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems. -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based, computer-assisted system which can be a starter system. Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988. Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity. Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies, including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media, fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to sell in the 700,000 dlr range. Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing 2.6 gigabytes. Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year. The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000. It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150,000 dlr range. Reuter

VBANGOR HYDRO BANG> SEEKS RATE CUT\u000a\u000aBangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a two-stage base rate reduction. Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln dlrs, or 9.7 pct. The company said lower federal income taxes and lower capital costs prompted the filing. The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.

The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1.

VPHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS\u000a\u000aPharmacia AB PHAB ST> forecast earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities. Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements. Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets. The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.

Fred Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had not worked. "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute for International Economics, said in a statement to a House Banking subcommittee. "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100 billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he said.

VSYRIA SAYS ISRAEL BLOCKS CITRUS EXPORT FROM GAZA\u000a\u000aSyria has complained to the United Nations that Israeli occupation authorities were blocking the export of citrus fruit from the Gaza Strip to the countries of the European Community, EC. In a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, published here today, Syrian U.N. charge d'affaires Abdul Mou'men Al-Atassi said: "These measures threaten to create a slump in citrus production, which constitutes the primary source of income in the Gaza Strip....They are causing heavy losses to farmers and all those working in the field of citrus production and threaten to bring about economic disaster." The Syrian envoy said the Israel action was a violation of the Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Charter and the "legitimacy of the economic rights endorsed by the United Nations." The Gaza Strip, occupied by Egypt in the 1948 Arab-Israel war, was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Reuter

VYUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA\u000a\u000aThere was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report. The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said. The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter. Reuter

The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to 2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter, was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04 billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs. The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1985. In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter quarter.

VBELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS\u000a\u000aBelgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States. De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries. But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will be a compromise." U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and access to community markets. De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States. U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards. He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the United States. De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988. He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule. Reuter

Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments.

VFORD CANADA FC> PROFIT DOWN ON CHANGEOVER COST\u000a\u000aFord Motor Co of Canada Ltd, 90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co F>, said the earlier reported decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant. Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs, partially offset by lower engine production. The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in 1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to 18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year. The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of 4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985, excluding export sales to its U.S. parent. Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion dlrs. The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies, cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were partially offset by lower industry volumes. Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased interest costs, the company said. Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct. Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986. Reuter

VFIRESTONE FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS\u000a\u000aFirestone Tire and Rubber Co has notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire plants on or before September 15. A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986. The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants. Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months. Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants, it added. Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers. Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits and work rules. Union procedures, however, require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board. The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants.

VVENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS\u000a\u000aVenezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders. Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image. "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said. Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion. "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year," Lusinchi said. He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case, because of the vulnerability of its economy." Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year. Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter, but that in any case it would become effective from April 1. Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support. Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation. He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord. "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise.

VROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES\u000a\u000aRoyal Bank of Canada> said it estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr increase over last year. Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their potential impact on the Royal Bank. The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to 114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago. Reuter

VNIGERIA, GUINEA SET UP IRON ORE FIRM WITH LIBERIA\u000a\u000aNigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said. The communique was issued after two days of talks here between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa. Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved, but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets. Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study. This would be completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank, which is also expected to give financial support. Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year, will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990. On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and silver.

VLONDON OPTIONS MARKET SEES CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH\u000a\u000aThe London Stock Exchange's traded options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year, and will more than double the range of options available by the end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain said. He told a news conference that more options contracts were traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's existence. Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from 19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth was expected. "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of 1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index. Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc PLYL.L> from March 19. The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present. Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate the London options market's leading position in Europe, especially important with French and Swiss equity options trading planned to start this year. "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least the next year. He said much of the recent growth in options had come from inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But now the retail options market was beginning to take off. The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading. Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987. The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the options market would need more than half of the available space. REUTER

VROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS\u000a\u000aRoyal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods. "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter

VBELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL\u000a\u000aBelgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could react was to retaliate. De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe." And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods. Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners. A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal. De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems." He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes on a lot of American products." He said "it would be stupid. We have to avoid that." He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles. De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West." He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines. "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers," De Croo said. reuter

VROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year. In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year. But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods. "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness," Rostenkowski said. "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market," he added. However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States. Reuter

VWALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC AAC>\u000a\u000aAnacomp Inc, one of the most actively traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a micrographics company. Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier. Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp GD>. "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half." Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said. A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986. Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added. Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share. In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts a share. Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said. Reuter

VU.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\u000a\u000aExport Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at." "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients. He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list. REUTER

VOILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87\u000a\u000aVisible stocks of 17 oils and fats are probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October 1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier. Its survey covered 13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun, rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and castor -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil, lard and tallow/greases. Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987, compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons. It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non-food purposes, it said. World consumption could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand. Oil World said it did not expect the European Community (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption. Reuter

VCOLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL\u000a\u000aCoffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said. "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein," Cardenas said.

VTALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS\u000a\u000aThe 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers. But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts. Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers. But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp GM>, Ford Motor Co F> and Chrysler Corp C>. Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and somewhat less so on Chrysler. And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable parts-making businesses. more

VSOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987\u000a\u000aSoviet imports of soymeal may reach or exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year, the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal. At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986. The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward, it said. Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.

VROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support. He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget. However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged. There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year. Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases. On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection. "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide," he said. This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year. Reuter

VAMR AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY\u000a\u000aThe deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co BA> and Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said. "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and Co. "They're called walkaway leases." AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft, which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers. AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its service in the Caribbean and to Europe. But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases. The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman Robert Crandall. "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms," Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the financing is provided by the manufacturers. A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said. Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet, long-range A300-600 planes. A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements. Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of planes, but not to this extent. Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into the early 1990s," he said. "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to reduce their exposure to risk, he added. Reuter

VIMF APPROVES 125.9 MLN SDR'S FOR JAMAICA\u000a\u000aThe International Monetary Fund said it approved 125.9 mln SDR's to assist development in Jamaica. Of this total, 85 mln SDR's can be drawn over the next 15 months under a standby arrangement in support of the government's economic and financial program. Another 40.9 mln is available immediately under the compensatory financing facility, the IMF's pool of funds to assist countries hit by export shortfalls. The IMF said that Jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due to reduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures. After some deterioration, the situation and prospects for Jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates, and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said. The program that the new funding supports is designed to continue the adjustment and restructuring effort so as to achieve sustained growth, a lower rate of inflation and a balance of payments viability in the medium term.

Fertility and Genetics said the non-surgical ovum transfer procedure will continue to remain a viable option for infertile couples to consider among the several alternative procedures available in advanced reproductive medicine.

VPERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS\u000a\u000aRecent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said. Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986. A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected. Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation. Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts. He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO. He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members. Reuter

VGAO SAYS FSLIC SHOWS DEFICIT, NEEDS FUNDS\u000a\u000aThe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential liability from insolvent savings associations, the General Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing. "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near future," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said. "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLIC would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end of 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations that continue to operate," Wolf said. He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize FSLIC. Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were insolvent. He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable, earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period. The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress. Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said are considered "hopelessly insolvent".

VGE GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER\u000a\u000aOne of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co BA> and 25 Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one order will have much of an effect on the stock." Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order "will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition." Reuter

The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast computerized libraries of documents and pictures. Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line. Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J. Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business imaging systems division. While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business products will exceed four billion dlrs this year. "We're launching a major attack on these new markets," Greco said. "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman. But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a profit," he said. Kodak also announced the first commerically available 14-inch optical disk.

Moody's said it took the action, which affects approximately 117 mln dlrs of debt, after examining Loral's acquisition of Goodyear Aerospace Corp.

VF.W. WOOLWORTH'S Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT\u000a\u000aThe specialty retailing area continues to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct. It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago. Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion. For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs. Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits. He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States. Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth, said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings." Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period. Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores. Reuter

VTREASURY'S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS\u000a\u000aAssistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease their debt burden. "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with measures to encourage new equity investment and the repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions. Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions for lending. "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said. He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt, create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

VCANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY\u000a\u000aCanadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said. "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number." "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she added. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand 2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year. Reuter

VBANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS\u000a\u000aThe Bank of England proposed that banks in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets. In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage. The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said. The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues. However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of England is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk. Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently. "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned...," the Bank's proposal said. Once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60 pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of capital. The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of 28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value. The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities, revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said. The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer. The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the supervision of financial institutions. It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act, aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks. The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors. Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10 and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed. However, preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed, it said. Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case-by-case basis rather than along general lines. Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies, the paper showed. They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities, and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks. Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed. Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said. The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees. It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department would probably not qualify for such treatment. On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases. But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said. On collateral security, it said this "should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base." "The presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

VREAGAN SAYS U.S. TO OFFER MISSILE TREATY\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan said the United States would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile reductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow. Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for consultations later this week. He said they will then return to Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact. Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces (INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said: "This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF reductions." "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text at Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said. He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles, "none is more important than verification ... Any agreement must be effectively verifiable." The United States has been working closely with allies and friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual elimination, the president said. He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in Reykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leader insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense. "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said. He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives, Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm to the companies they target. "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a country ... can base a future on." Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British industrialist Sir James Goldsmith. But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price, Mercer said. The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs, giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over two billion dlrs. In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved, sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its payroll by 10 pct, he said. Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile takeovers have also hurt workers. Reuter

VSOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE\u000a\u000aSoviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.

VALCAN (AL) TO CLOSE WEST GERMAN SMELTER\u000a\u000a(Alcan Aluminium Ltd) is closing its aluminum smelter in Ludwigshafen, West Germany this June due to high operating costs, an Alcan spokesman said. The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about 44,000 metric tons but was operating at about half that in January, spokesman Fernand Leclerc said. Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to modernize the plant. He said there is a possibility the company will sell the smelter, which currently employs 320 people, before its scheduled closing. Reuter

VOIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT\u000a\u000aCrude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales," Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally." He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. "The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result," Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

VCOFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS\u000a\u000aCoffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it is time to go and sell coffee." But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said. Reuter

VU.S. WINE EXPORTS ROSE 15 PER CENT LAST YEAR\u000a\u000aExports of American wine rose 14.9 per cent last year to a total of 7.2 million gallons, the Wine Institute said. The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent of the exported wine was from California and the top three markets were Canada, Japan and Britain. Japan, which edged out Britain as the leading importer of American wines in 1985, continued in second place. Canadian imports rose 3.2 per cent to 2.6 million gallons; Japan, 9.9 per cent to 1.2 million gallons, and Britain, 20.2 per cent to 962,360 gallons. A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the California wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments. The 1986 wine exports were valued at 34.7 mln dlrs, up from 27.6 mln dlrs the previous year. Reuter

VU.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL SEES LATIN DEBT PROGRESS\u000a\u000aAssistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and Brazil. "This should result in substantial new lending for the major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the U.S. House of Representatives. Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package, Mulford said. Reuter

VNEW CANADA ISSUE ALMOST SOLD OUT AT CLOSE\u000a\u000aCanada's 1.20 billion dlr bond offer was virtually sold out as bond prices closed weaker in moderate trading, dealers said. Sales of today's issue were slowed by the decline in American credit markets and rising oil prices, which stirred concerns about inflation, the traders said. The issue was selling at or just below issue price. Overall prices fell as much as a point, with the benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001 at 106-3/8 5/8, the 8-1/4 pct of 1997 at 99 99-1/4 and the 8-1/2 pct of 2011 at 98-1/8 3/8. Reuter

VGM GM> TO REPUCHASE COMMON STOCK\u000a\u000aGeneral Motors Corp said its directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par value common stock by the end of 1990. GM said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed 10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock. It said the stock repurchase, as market conditions permit, will be funded from a portion of the cash flows generated by reduced capital spending and anticipated performance improvements. GM also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as five mln shares each of its class E and class H common, with about half of the proposed repurchases completed by year end. GM also said it is considering offering an odd-lot repurchase program for its class H stock by mid-year. GM said the class E and H repurchases would increase participation in the net income of its Electronic Data Systems Corp GME> and Hughes Electronic Corp GMH> subsidiaries by holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common. GM also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending, excluding EDS and Hughes Aircraft Co, to 7.9 billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6 billion dlrs in 1986. It also said improvements in operating performance are expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990. "We have one overriding objective--to position GM so that it is producing the best products available in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," said Chairman Roger B. Smith. GM had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class E and 66.6 mln shares of class H outstanding at year end 1986. GM said that its par value holders currently participate in the 56 pct of the earnings of EDS and 67 pct of Hughes' earnings. GM also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all three classes of its common in connection with ongoing requirements of various benefit plans. That buyback, it said, will involve about nine mln shares of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class E and H common in 1987. GM said the repuchased shares of its par value common will be held in its treasury indefinitely for possible future business use. Reuter

VU.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected developing countries, committee staff said. The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said. The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs -- PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries. The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates. The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria. Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco. Other countries could be added to the list. Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow. Reuter

VU.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS\u000a\u000aThe U.S. is sticking for the moment to its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debt payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and not with governments, U.S. officials said. "I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to do," a senior administration official stated. "Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point," said another official following an assessment of that country's latest debt crisis. The official, who asked that his name not be used, said the National Security Council, the Treasury and State departments and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation. In a related development, small regional banks that have made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker here tomorrow. Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems. Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service its debt. The official said the interagency meeting was called to discuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro." Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker, Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials. Another senior administration official said he was perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines. "We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems bizarre, just bizarre," the official said. One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense," and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil, for which that country was in arrears. Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but wanted to avoid a confrontation. The consensus among administration officials seems to be that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic economic problems. "Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their economic policy," a senior official added. Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at the Fed's suggestion. "Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they want to say something," one regional bank official said. But other banking sources said that regional banks, many of which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, are dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, in the refinancing of foreign debts. The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors, and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve role in the rescheduling process.

VFCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA\u000a\u000aTotal supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter

VSECURITIES TAX WOULD NEED WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions, before considering the issue, a staff member said. In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday as a possible way to cut the federal deficit. The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax. However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place. Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17 billion dlrs a year, the aide said. The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities transactions." NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement, "Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide and would be counter-productive, making America's securities industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time when financial markets are becoming increasingly international."

VU.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS\u000a\u000aEligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate. Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate. The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said. The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said. Reuter

VPENNZOIL PZL> SAYS IT HAS MADE SETTLEMENT OFFERS\u000a\u000aPennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtke said the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc TX> to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and that a settlement was "in the best interests of both companies." Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders, said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling the case. "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before and after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in the letter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make such clearly untrue statements." Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the total amount back above 10 billion dlrs. Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit. "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers, Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter. "In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not accept." The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made by either Pennzoil or Texaco. "If and when Texaco's management changes its position and demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to cooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, is clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and directors." Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and profits from those assets that have since been sold "approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion dlrs for Getty. Reuter

VHILTON HOTELS HLT> GIVEN RIGHT TO SUE IRS\u000a\u000aHilton Hotels Corp said it received approval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks. That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up by the late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp, worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hilton attorneys. Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase those 6,782,000 shares, the company said. However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the Hilton Corp. That act said that a private foundation could not own more than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over that figure had to be sold. The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will, Barron had the option to buy the seven pct, according to the Hilton lawyers. Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax law, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block of stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron was attempting to keep the large block from going public, leaving the family in control of the corporation. Reuter

VAUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA\u000a\u000aThe Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said. Reuter

VITT ITT> CONSIDERING STOCK REPURCHASE\u000a\u000aITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told a meeting of analysts that the company has been considering a repurchase of some shares. "We are considering that as a very important way to increase earnings per share," Araskog said and noted the aim was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market. ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share a year ago. Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares being studied for repurchase. "We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988," Araskog told the analysts. "We have more confidence...than any other time in our history - at least with me." Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s. Last year, the company transferred its European telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie Generale d'Electricite, called Alcatel N.V. ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture. Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year, Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small companies was recently concluded. "We really wrapped everything up," he said adding that the company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock transfers. Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany receiveables, which should be paid by the end of March. Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was considering repurchasing some shares, but a spokesman noted that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of the sharp appreciation in its stock price. Breaking out operating earnings by divisions, ITT said diversified services, which consists of insurance, financial services, communications and hotels, saw the sharpest rise in operating income, to 454 mln dlrs, from 297 mln dlrs a year ago.

VJAPAN CUTTING CHINA CORN COMMITMENTS - USDA\u000a\u000aJapanese traders have apparently sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices. If the reports are confirmed, China's major export destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said. China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said. Reuter

VSAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said. "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil. Reuter

VEC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA\u000a\u000aThe European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

VSOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA\u000a\u000aDespite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year. The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said. Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan. But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said. Reuter

VCBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS\u000a\u000aChicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said. Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years. Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops.

VGM GM> BUYBACK SEEN CALMING SHAREHOLDERS\u000a\u000aWall Street analysts said a share repurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year. "He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analyst Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm of criticism from people on the institutional side." Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the shares in the near term but some had reservations about the long term effects of the plan. "They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by the buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor Co's F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis than that of Chrysler Corp C>. Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy back stock on a large scale. The General Motors plan, announced after a board of directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20 pct of the common stock by the end of 1990. The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln class E GME> and class H GMH> shares. GM shares closed at 75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78. "The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," said Ronald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities. "I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming from unless they borrow," Glantz said. "Their credit rating is going to fall." GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending. Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has 37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will be seen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said. "GM must be challenging the union to make it the strike target." Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think the overall plan was "prudent." "Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in the stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said. He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels "they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the confines of their cash flow." Phillippi, who has been telling clients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance "we've got to feel they're doing something constructive." Reuter

VROCKWELL ROK> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987\u000a\u000aRockwell International Corp continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results, despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters. Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago. Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term, we have a very serious problem." In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S. Reuter

VREAGAN SEEKS MORE AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan, seeking to salvage his Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said a major U.S. economic program for the region was working but needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned. In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approval of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992. The report, mandated by Congress, explains how the administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developed a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels. The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989. "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefed reporters, said the administration will not try to link approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with the vastly more popular economic package for the region, as some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested. He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra scandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr allotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fighting Managua's leftist Sandinista government. Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest fight in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believed a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time in six years -- would back the military request.

VSWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT\u000a\u000aThe International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's co-chairman. The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation," Japsper said. Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a "level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules.

VANDRIESSEN HAILS EC MILK PACT, PROMISES FARM AID\u000a\u000aEuropean Community Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses. "We are now in a favourable position to improve the situation in the dairy sector," he told a news conference. The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of butter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new stocks from accruing. A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in December, but approval was held up by a row over Commission proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus stocks into store. After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed rules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public stocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores. Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for cuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming season. The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay compensation to those who opt for less intensive production methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections had forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years. He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older farmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out of agricultural production or passing it to successors. The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports to hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give full details, but member state aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition." Reuter

VITALIAN TREASURY TO ISSUE NEW CERTIFICATES\u000a\u000aThe Italian treasury said it will issue 3,000 billion lire of a new type of indexed government paper, discount certificates (CTS), on March 18. Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said at a news conference the new certificates will be heavily discounted and aimed at small investors rather than institutions. The Treasury said in a statement the annual yield of the seven-year certificates will be indexed to 50 pct of the annual yield of 12-month treasury bills. Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue will be 9.66 pct. "The launch of the new certificate has to be viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate issues," the Treasury said. The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and variable-rate investments.

VGREECE PLANS TO REDUCE 1987 FOREIGN BORROWING\u000a\u000aGreece aims to reduce foreign borrowing to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986, and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris Halikias, said. He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost. Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said. He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures. He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985. Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year. He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for imports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive. Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion.

VB.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY\u000a\u000aBritish Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs. Reuter

VVENEZUELA SETS FOREIGN DEBT TARGETS\u000a\u000aVenezuela plans to have a public sector foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term, public finances director Jorge Marcano said. He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable amount which will assist in development plans. The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8 pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct. In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision to suspend interest payments. "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil announcement came later," he said. Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile, objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before Venezuela's. Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans, which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "We cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new agreement and present the financing programmes we have," he said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s. Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next two years. According to the restructured accord, this would work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs. REUTER

VSENATE'S PROXMIRE URGES CURBS ON TAKEOVERS\u000a\u000aSenate Banking Committee chairman William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs. "At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing on corporate takeovers. "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and investment banking," Proxmire said. He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman David Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game to continue unchecked, would be economic suicide," Champion International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added. Reuter

VSPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE\u000a\u000aSpain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said. "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he said. "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure," he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets. "They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad." REUTER

VCOMMISSION REPORT WARNS ON EC FINANCING\u000a\u000aThe European Community is close to bankruptcy, the EC's Executive Commission said in a report. In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on the brink of bankruptcy." The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign ministers are due to start debating next month. The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the "considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions they themselves have taken. "Budgetary practices have emerged which fictitiously disguise the real impact of expenditure decisions," it said. Adding that such practices were unacceptable. It put the EC's accumulated liabilities at the end of last year at 12.2 billion European Currency Units and estimated these would rise by a further five billion Ecus this year. REUTER

He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering opening a branch in London. Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly 29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from 42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks. The group balance sheet, including for the first time VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9 billion marks, Luckey said. The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct. Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own account contributed to record operating profits. Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said. Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory. The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct. The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986, and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said. REUTER

VPS NEW MEXICO PNM> STUDIES SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP\u000a\u000aPublic Service Co of New Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln dlrs. The utility said it advised a customer task force this is one restructuring alternative being considered for the company's electric business. The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's overall initiative in response to several goals announced by New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained. Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its reorganization concept would be to separate the company's electric utility operation into independent generation and distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted 35 mln dlr a year rate decrease. Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes "the concept may well have an application in the utility business and intend to investigate it fully." The generation company would provide projected power needs of the distribution entity under a 30-year "power security agreement" which would have a federally regulated rate structure, the company said. Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986. This holding company would be the general partner of the limited partnership, the company said. The company said its limited partnership concept was presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov. Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals. It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an alternative structure that would help reduce rates through a lower overall cost of capital. Last month the governor said "I have outlined to PNM critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may administration in achieving" adding the goals include immediate rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation of business expansion. The company told the task force the new distribution company, under the limited partnership alternative or otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state regulators. PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and transmission services. The generation company would have no retail customers. PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would also be needed by FERC. Reuter

The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operating as a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stg pct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were sold out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bonds started trading this morning at 20 stg pct. Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength. Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from both domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan and the U.S. Although the issue had not been designated as free of tax to residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment for the market in general had generated foreign buying. The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it was announced and dealers said that even first thing this morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable existing stocks. However, sterling's continuing firm performance had prompted interest in the tap right at the outset. The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of the major part of the price until April 27, but also conferred a substantial gearing element. This meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total purchase price was tied up initially.

VCOMMISSION REPORT WARNS ON EC FINANCING\u000a\u000aThe European Community is close to bankruptcy, the EC's Executive Commission said in a report. In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on the brink of bankruptcy." The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign ministers are due to start debating next month. The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the "considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions they themselves have taken. Reuter

The proposal, which needs approval by EC ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban. "It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said. But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to stock. Reuter

VLEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER\u000a\u000aA leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters. About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus "corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had," one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages," one official said. "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said. Reuter

VU.S. CAR MAKERS HOPE TO PROFIT FROM WEAK DOLLAR\u000a\u000aThe Geneva Motor Show, the first major car show of the year, opens tomorrow with U.S. Car makers hoping to make new inroads into European markets due to the cheap dollar, automobile executives said. Ford Motor Co F> and General Motors Corp GM> sell cars in Europe, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM also makes a few thousand in North American plants for European export. Now Chrysler Corp C> is saying it will begin exporting American-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, a market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy. Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last year -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European market. Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain and Britain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about 1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said. James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped for a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made vehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (North American-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. "A low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told Reuters. Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million and 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added. That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500 North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs. Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture all of its cars sold on the continent. But Walter Hayes, vice president of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect a large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. "We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe is inevitably a small volume market." Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to European environmental specifications cut into profit margins. But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said the weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to re-enter the European market," he said. "We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar."

VBUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM\u000a\u000aThe Bundesbank is planning changes in the system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument, central bank officials said. Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently, enabling the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly. The changes will probably come into force in April. Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business. Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks, which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level. Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area. The change to come into force next month will allow the Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself, in a process legally comparable to direct debiting. At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday. The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28 days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary. For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow (Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt yesterday (Tuesday). Central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical, with no direct implications for interest rates. "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter," said an official at the Hesse LZB. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago, and praised their flexibility. The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible, banking economists said. By speeding up the tender process, they will make it possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks, to respond to changing money market conditions. "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," said Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger. The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest rates, he said. REUTER

VGERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987\u000a\u000aThe cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986, when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the HWWA economic research institute said. The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report. The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987. Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier. The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17 dlrs per barrel. REUTER

VWORLD BANK SAYS S. AMERICAN DEBTORS STILL TALKING\u000a\u000aLatin American debtor nations are still willing to negotiate on their debts, World Bank director for Latin America and the Caribbean Rainer Steckhan said. In an article published in today's Handelsblatt daily, Steckhan said despite decisions by Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Brazil to suspend some interest payments, these nations were still willing to talk constructively about their debts. "These countries are still prepared to negotiate, and the instruments of cooperation developed thus far provide the means to deal with the crisis over time," Steckhan said. Several highly indebted nations have made great efforts to meet their debt payments, especially Latin American countries, Steckhan said. Chile achieved gross national product growth of five to six pct last year and quadrupled its trade surplus from 1984, despite lower prices of key commodity exports like copper. Mexico, hit by a catastrophic earthquake and declines in world oil prices also boosted its non-oil exports by one third in 1986, the highest growth rate in its post-war history. The World Bank's annual lending to Latin America rose to 4.8 billion dlrs last year from three billion in 1984, he said. REUTER

VFED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE\u000a\u000aThe Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations." The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Reuter

These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously.

VEC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE\u000a\u000aThe 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this "extensification" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition." EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed. Reuter

VNATIONAL FUEL NFG> PROPOSES ARGO REORGANIZATION\u000a\u000aNational Fuel Gas Co said it has proposed a plan of reorganization for Argo Petroleum Corp>. The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources Corp subsidiary to receive 75 pct of Argo's principal producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing Argo's debt to Seneca. The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said. National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs. National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would allow it to capitalize, together with other assets, a new company for its existing shareholders. National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing secured debt to be refinanced in an 8,875,000 dlr refinancing note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas properties. Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly owned properties. In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's existing debt, Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the venture's development costs, National Fuel Gas said. It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange for their claims against the company.

VU.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS\u000a\u000aThe Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said. The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively." At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation," and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

VU.S. PRESENTS MOSCOW WITH DRAFT MISSILE TREATY\u000a\u000aThe United States today handed Soviet arms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate all superpower medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and slash such weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side. Maynard Glitman, who heads the American team discussing medium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "a full treaty text," was now on the negotiating table. The proposal responds to a new Soviet offer to abolish "Euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forces elsewhere announced by Mikhail Gorbachev last Saturday. The developments have been described by many disarmament experts as the first real opening for a superpower accord since they resumed arms control talks in March 1985. Glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a half hour meeting at the American diplomatic mission with the Soviet team on medium-range missiles headed by Lem Masterkov. He told reporters: "It is a complete document. It has to be because we want precision. We don't want any ambiguities." The draft called for elimination - removal and destruction - of all superpower medium-range missiles in Europe over five years and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomic warheads on each side, Glitman added. In Europe, this includes 270 Soviet triple-warhead SS-20's and 316 single-warhead U.S. Pershing-2 and cruise missiles. Reuter

VGREAT NORTHERN NEKOOSA GNN> ANNOUNCES SPLIT\u000a\u000aThe Great Northern Nekoosa Corp said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common stock split. The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's Great Southern Paper division operations. In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the company said. The company said it will propose an increase in its dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June payment. The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct higher than the current rate. The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said. As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN common stock outstanding, according to the company. Reuter

Cuomo said. He told a press conference the 132.5 mln dlr reduction in annual rates, along with the removal of 50 mln dlrs in fuel charges from base rates are part of an agreement which will reduce the utility's base electric rates by about 500 mln dlrs per year over the next three years and bar any rate increases until at least April 1990. Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which must be approved by the State Public Service Commission, was negotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, Public Servcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General, the City of New York and several other parties. He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctric rate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years. As a result of an earlier stipulation, we have already had a four year freeze on Con Edison's base electric rates since March 1983," he added. Con Edison said the agreement reflects reduced federal taxes and lower interest rates. The utility said another factor includes improved economic conditions in the New York City area, which led to increased sales. It pointed out "declining fuel costs have resulted in an average 10 pct decrease in our customers' bills since 1984." Reuter

VCOFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.\u000a\u000aFailure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by "objective criteria", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position." However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers," said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. Reuter

VIBM IBM> DEMONSTRATES NEW CHIP\u000a\u000aInternational Business Machines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light into electrical signals that translate into computer language. IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second. The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits. IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient in turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems to be an ideal material for the light-based computer communications expected to be widely used in the future. The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector and transistor circuitry close together. Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and distortion, it said. Reuter

VTORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST\u000a\u000aTorrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter

VU.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS\u000a\u000aSen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they planted. Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton. The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body. Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme. If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it.

Brazil would not repeat the measures it took in response to its debt crisis of 1982, which he said had provoked the biggest recession in his country's history, he added. He said European and Japanese banks were showing a more flexible attitude towards Brazil's problems than U.S. Banks and it was difficult to discuss capitalisation with the latter. A Swiss official said the Brazilian delegation had made no demands. Funaro, who travels to Italy this evening, said it was unclear if he would go to Japan on Friday or return to Brazil first. REUTER

VGATT TO RULE ON U.S. CUSTOMS USER FEE DISPUTE\u000a\u000aThe world trade body GATT has decided to set up an arbitration panel to rule on objections by Canada and the European Community to a customs user fee imposed by the U.S. Government, a GATT spokesman said. Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) council meeting that the fee, which imposes a tax on an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, is illegal under GATT rules. U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed by the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, does not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many other countries. Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine the dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it. In another development, Hong Kong, supported by a large number of developing countries, attacked the "textile and apparel trade act of 1987" introduced in the U.S. Congress last February 19. Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is "blatantly protectionist." He added there is "almost nothing about the bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent with either the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)." If the bill were to be passed by Congress, Cartland said "it would forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation of world trade in textiles." GATT's council also decided to set up a working party to study China's application for full GATT membership. The group is due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15. Reuter

VTURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986\u000a\u000aTurkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said. He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year. This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful," he said. Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. "We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years," he added. His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit," he said. Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained. "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered. "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said. He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.

VENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION\u000a\u000aDrilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects," said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs," Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year," Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels," Guerard said. Reuter

"There are difficulties (among the banks) to reach an agreement and find a unanimous decision," Marx told a local radio station in a telephone interview from New York. Argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said. Marx is in New York with Argentina's debt negotiating team holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee. Marx said the talks should not drag on.

Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership. Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our strategic plans," he said. That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs. An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a "decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said. Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical to strike before the offering is underway. Reuter

But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero.

VESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC\u000a\u000aThe size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said. He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86. Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention. A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount. The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86. The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said. Reuter

VS. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said. He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation. Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan. Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources." Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts." He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the U.S. He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be," considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense. Reuter

VCANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES\u000a\u000aThe Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers. "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop." Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts. But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year. Reuter

VGATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS\u000a\u000aThe ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors. David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15. The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors. The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries. The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market. Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate. Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks. Reuter

VTALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS GM>\u000a\u000aGeneral Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value." However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors," he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co F> and Chrysler Corp C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds," he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM," he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important." Reuter

VECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL\u000a\u000aHealthy growth in corporate profits and in consumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the core, economists polled by Reuters said. Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth, they said. Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits. The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily. However, this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports. "No clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced," the central bank said. Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer. Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors. The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports. Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer. A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves. Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance, said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara. Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down wages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now. Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging. Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza. To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods. Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education, and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary. The last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age. Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited. The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less than excited at the results. Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited. The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate at only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said. Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit, official figures show. Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment. The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity. Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price inflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition. REUTER

VTOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS\u000a\u000aFrench oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986, after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the company said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said. Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February." Reuter

VTEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS\u000a\u000aTexas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way." Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

VCOLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE\u000a\u000aColombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986. Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter

VPACTEL PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH\u000a\u000aPacific Telesis Group chairman Donald Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs, or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986. Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed. Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company. In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the commission, he said the figure might even be greater. The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs. Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan. "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating. Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion. "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business." However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies. He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration," he said. Reuter

VSENATE COMMITTEE ISSUES REVISED BANK BILL\u000a\u000aThe Senate Banking Committee has issued a revised draft bank regulation bill which would permit so-called non-bank banks to continue all their activities in progress as of March 5, 1987. The bill, which the committee is scheduled to consider tomorrow, would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new activities after March 5, increase the number of their locations or cross-market products or services not permissible for bank holding companies. The bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank securities or insurance activities.

VKENYA SIGNS PACT TO ESTABLISH OWN SHIPPING LINE\u000a\u000aKenya has signed an agreement with British and German interests to establish a shipping line that will handle 40 pct of the country's external trade, sources close to the deal said. The state-owned Kenya Ports Authority, KPA, signed an agreement with the Hamburg-based shipping line Unimar Seetransport to establish the Kenya National Shipping line, with an initial capital of 100 mln shillings, sources said. KPA will hold 70 pct of the shares in the new company. The line will initially charter vessels to operate services between Mombasa and the main ports of industrial Europe, but may eventually build or buy its own ships. The sources said it would aim to carry a large part of Kenya's coffee and tea exports and oil and fertiliser imports. Reuter

VNEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY\u000a\u000aU.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said. After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals. "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default. "The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. "What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph). Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design. "One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court," said one bank official. Reuter

VSPEAKES SAYS HE, REAGAN MISLED PUBLIC UNWITTINGLY\u000a\u000aFormer White House spokesman Larry Speakes said he and President Reagan misled the public unintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because they themselves were misled by others. In a televised interview, Speakes was contrasting the defensive, much-criticized efforts Reagan made in early attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he expected when the president addressed the nation tonight. "When we went into those press conferences and that nationwide address in November right after the (Iran) story broke, the president did not have the proper information," Speakes said. "And that's why we were misled. And consequently, the president and I misled the public, to a certain extent." "We were badly served by the people that were involved in the Iranian crisis and running the show." Asked whom he meant, Speakes said former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter; and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North. Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of events "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts ..." McFarlane has said that he, North and Poindexter had doctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimize Reagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as part of an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 news conference. Reuter

VBANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS\u000a\u000aThe Canadian government's reduced borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report. The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed unevenly while inflation remained a major concern. Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly more through short term treasury bill financings. "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by deputy governor John Crow last month. The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was 69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984. The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange transactions. Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to five year maturities, Bouey said. Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion dlrs in March, 1986. The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the advances. Reuter

It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all of CTS. Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the company's 1987 annual meeting. Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the outstanding stock. Dynamics said the price of stock under the option, exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price for the stock for the five days ending March two. Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the additional title of President. Former President Robert D. Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial Officer Gary B.

VCME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION\u000a\u000aChicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, directors have postponed action on a membership petition calling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandner told Reuters. Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular board meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions of a special committee that has been studying trading conditions in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six months. "We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said. Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findings of the special S and P committee, which is considering some type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures. Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity for traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at more favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner said he expects the special committee to report its findings late next week and the board to act when those findings are presented. In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a ban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P 500 futures at a prior meeting. The change was withheld, however, at the request of the special committee after a study was released and the committee felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively, Sandner said. Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on dual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to a ban on dual trading." Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500 futures and options on futures. In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P trading pit, Melamed said. Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special committee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are usually approved by the exchange board of directors. Reuter

VRENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN\u000a\u000aProspects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview. The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," Melnikov said. "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said. Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement. "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said. Reuter

Some 2,800 workers of the plant's 3,300 hourly employees will be temporarily laid off for 18 weeks from March five through mid-July. The other 500 workers will remain at the plant in maintenance, retooling and material handling jobs. Chrysler said the 367 mln dlr expenditure is part of a 720 mln dlr development program at Belvidere. The rest of the money will be spent developing Chrysler's New York and Dodge Dynasty four-door sedans to be built at the plant. Modernization of the 22-year-old facility is part of Chrysler's five-year, 12.5 billion dlr company-wide program to bring its manufacturing operations up to current standards. Chrysler said it will increase the number of robots at Belvidere to 244 from 41. The robots will be used in welding, material handling and sealing. Chrysler will also help retrain the plant's workforce. The State of Illinois has committeed 10 mln dlrs in training funds to the project. When the plant reopens in July, Chrysler workers will have completed more than five mln classrom and on-the-job hours in retraining, the company said. The July restart will be on a single-shift basis. Second-shift production will start this fall. Reuter

"I think the president wants to give his side of the story." The official said Reagan would tell the public what he is doing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorching Tower commission report on the origins of the scandal. It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of many of his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policy was wrong and he personally made some mistakes. Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would say he erred, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, "His views are intensely personal and I won't give you any advance on what he intends to say in that area." He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length and that Reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalized White House that will pursue an active foreign policy."

He'll focus on changes he's making in the structure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goals for the next two years," the spokesman said.

The company's 2.61 billion dlrs in first mortgage bonds were downgraded to DP-4 (low AA) from DP-3 (middle AA). The ratings on its debentures and preferred stock valued at 213 mln and 619 mln dlrs, respectively, were lowered to DP-5 (high A) from DP-4. Duff and Phelps said the utility's debt ratings were lowered because of the recent negative rate order for its Hope Creel nuclear plants.

VMORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF\u000a\u000aCongressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef. Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea. Daub was joined by several other lawmakers. U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied "we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues. Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said. In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress, administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets."

VU.S. DAIRY PRICE SUPPORT CUT SEEN LIKELY IN 1988\u000a\u000aThe chairman of the U.S. House subcommittee on dairy, livestock and poultry issues, Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.), said it is likely the U.S. dairy support price will be cut next year. "It looks like the price cut may take place," Stenholm said at a hearing today on dairy issues. Under the 1985 farm bill, the Agriculture Secretary can lower the U.S. milk price support to 10.60 dlrs per cwt from the current 11.35 dlrs if government purchases of dairy products are forecast to exceed five billion lbs in 1988. The U.S. Agriculture Department forecasts government purchases of dairy products will total six to seven billion lbs in fiscal 1987, but says the level of purchases beyond 1987 will depend on the production decisions of dairy farmers.

VMORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE\u000a\u000aWhether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States. "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices," he said in an interview. Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices. "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms." "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?" he said. The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it. Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said. "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered," he said. Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels. Reuter

VLEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA\u000a\u000aKey tax and budget lawmakers Wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new securities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street and put pressure on brokerage stocks. Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target of 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues. The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5 percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year. Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said. The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan maintains his staunch opposition. "First we've got to decide whether to raise additional revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early," Rostenkowski said in a statement. He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting Tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source said. The idea was presented only as something that might or might not be valuable, he said. House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was another option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said. The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend specific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in 1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision on how the taxes will be raised. The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target. But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and there were uncertainties about the details of the tax. Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said. At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that are guaranteed to anger those who must pay. "We could just do all of them," one congressional source said of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil import fee and others. Reuter

VAMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES\u000a\u000aThe directors of the American Farm Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations. "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill," said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation. "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced," Kleckner said. The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market. A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate. The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather. Reuter

VU.S. SEMICONDUCTOR PLAN RAISES ANTITRUST ISSUE\u000a\u000aA plan by U.S. semiconductor firms to cooperate in a manufacturing facility to compete with firms in Japan could conflict with anti-monopoly law, the plan's backers said. The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a news conference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH to build an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant. Asked whether U.S. antitrust regulators might object, Charles Sporck, president of National Semiconductor Corp, said, "That is a possibility." Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest in the project but he declined to estimate how much would be sought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH would require. Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational plan ready by June 1. Then it will search for a site for the manufacturing facility and an executive to head up the consortium. The consortium could be operating by the end of the year, and the facility working in 18 months, he said. International Business Machines Corp hopes to participate in the effort, Paul Low, an IBM executive, said. He said the project suppliers of raw materials and others vital to the semiconductor industry, such as toolmakers, would be invited to participate. Sporck said no decision was made on what product would be produced, stressing that the emphasis was on developing technology and sharing that with firms which belonged to SEMATECH. Other aspects were still undecided, such as whether a Japanese firm with a facility in the United States would be allowed to participate, he said. Reuter

VVIACOM VIA> MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS\u000a\u000aSumner Redstone, president of National Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International Inc in 60 to 90 days. Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. "We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel," Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will be a company expense," Redstone said. He said BankAmerica BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs. After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands. Reuter

VBRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM\u000a\u000aA senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate." His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion." Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines." He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better." He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?" reuter

VUAW, AMC AMO> SET NEW LABOR TALKS\u000a\u000aThe United Auto Workers and American Motors Corp agreed to resume talks on a new labor contract for the company's threatened Kenosha, Wisc. assembly plant despite a breakdown in talks last weekend, UAW vice-president Marc Stepp said. Stepp told reporters that issues which caused the talks to break off are being discussed between the two sides and that a main table bargaining session has been scheduled Friday in Milwaukee. France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault has a controlling stake in American Motors. Stepp said the union intends "to exert full efforts" to reach an agreement that would keep the plant in operation past 1989, when AMC has said production will end unless the UAW grants concessions on labor costs. The UAW leader said the company and the union agreed in principle in 1985 to pattern a future contract covering some 6,000 Kenosha workers after lower-cost UAW contracts covering Mazda Motor Corp's new U.S. plant in Michigan and the New United Motor plant in California operated by Toyota. Stepp said there is such deep hostility between the company and union locals in Milwaukee and Kenosha that communication between them is very difficult. But he said it is possible to reach agreement on a new contract to save the jobs of UAW members at AMC's Wisconsin operations despite the impasse. AMC has said it will resume talks, but only for 24 hours to ascertain whether the union was willing to agree to the concessions it wants. The Kenosha plant builds AMC's Renault cars and a line of Chrysler Corp C> vehicles under a contract assembly deal. Reuter

Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told Reuters in response to an inquiry. Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3 billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to implement the debt plan now under negotiation. Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following release of the plan to lenders. Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle from creditors prior to June 30. The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with cash flow generated by assets backing the loans. Annesley also said there was no change in the status of legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt. Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss franc denominated debt in default. Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a Swiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.

VTWA TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT PIE> SITUATION\u000a\u000aTrans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon." Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement," said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share. Reuter

VUSDA TRANSMITS FARM PROPOSALS TO CONGRESS\u000a\u000aThe Reagan administration officially submitted to Congress its proposals to cut back U.S. farmers' income deficiency payments, decouple planting decisions from income support levels and accelerate reductions in loan rates, Senate staff said. The recommendations, first outlined last January in President Reagan's fiscal 1988 budget blueprint, were transmitted to both houses of Congress as legislative proposals. It was not clear which lawmakers might introduce the measures. The most controversial proposal in the package would make 10 pct annual reductions in target prices for major commodities. A number of legislators have predicted the target price proposal will not move in Congress. The package also would offer the so-called 0/92 option to producers of 1987-90 crops and raise the annual permissible reduction in loan rates to 10 pct from 5 pct. Under 0/92, a producer is guaranteed at least 92 pct of his deficiency payment regardless of how much he plants. Reuter

VYEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER\u000a\u000aU.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year. "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget. Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said. "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business," Yeutter said. "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he added. Reuter

VRIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT\u000a\u000aThe failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said. He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected. "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year," Calmon added. Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export. "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction," he added. In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags. Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added. The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe it was higher than this. Reuter

The officials said discussion of a U.S. Agriculture Department wheat export subsidy to the Soviet Union was not on the agenda. Matters not on the agenda, however, can be brought before the council, the officials said. Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow, but USDA officials have said the matter is not under active consideration. USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative proposals, including bills that would cut target prices and speed up loan rate reductions. Reuter

VU.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN\u000a\u000aA meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European Community, U.S. trade officials said. Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure on EC member states. "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S. trade official. One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great cost." U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up. "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package. Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said "sometimes its better not to be specific." U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax. Reuter

VU.S. CAR SALES UP 6.7 PCT IN LATE FEBRUARY\u000a\u000aSales of new cars by the U.S. auto industry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of a year ago, but industry giant General Motors Corp GM> was an exception with an eight pct drop. The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry from weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month from last year. GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months, took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28 period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the entire industry were depressed from the ending of major marketing incentive campaigns. At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co F> said its car sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp C> was up 11.3 pct. The industry leader's slide was even more marked for the full month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February, including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago. Industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars sold in the seven selling days of late February represented a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the 556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate. Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars, including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in 1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack of widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather, analysts said. GM sales vice-president C.N. "Bud" Moore said in a statement that his company's sales "began their recovery from the low point reached in January, and we expect the improvement to continue in coming months." Anne Knight, automotive analyst for Paine Webber and Co, told Reuters that GM's sales were weak, but added: "I think sales will get better in the spring." "GM may make more production cuts in view of the weak sales, but this may be a strike year so they might try to build inventories," she said. In a further effort to revive sales, GM said its Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Buick divisions would offer many of their new car lines through April 30 with discount loan packages at rates ranging from 3.9 pct for 24-month contracts to 9.9 pct for 60-month deals as an alternative to cash rebates. Among the smaller U.S.-based manufacturers, Japanese-owned American Honda HMC> said its late February car sales rose 96.2 pct from last year while Japanese-owned Nissan NSANY> was up 35.9 pct. German-owned Volkswagen of America fell 42.5 pct, American Motors Corp AMO> plunged 62.5 pct and Japan's Toyota TOYOY> sold 1,082 domestic makes compared with none a year ago before it started domestic production. Detroit's late February truck sales were generally positive with GM up 10.9 pct, Ford up 48 pct, Chrysler gaining 46 pct and AMC's jeep sales off 4.0 pct. Imported cars sales, released monthly, were estimated at 219,300 in February, a 0.4 pct rise from last year and 28.3 pct of the overall car market. That was lower than January's 31.4 pct share but above the 26.3 pct share a year ago. Reuter

VCANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH\u000a\u000aBank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986. "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank's annual report in the House of Commons today. He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy, particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter. Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark. The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in debt plagued countries such as Brazil. "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told reporters. Reuter

VALLIS-CHALMERS AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING\u000a\u000aAllis-Chalmers Corp said it asked lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock. The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds. Under the plan, which was presented to institutional lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company. Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in a statement. Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common. Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors, common and preferred holders,and present and former employees. Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached." The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring. "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said. Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met. Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made "at substantially reduced levels." Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling and solid materials processing. Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio. Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs. The company will also sell its fluids handling operations, which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues. Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs, or 12.27 dlrs a share. The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4 mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs. Reuter

VFORMER TRWTRW> EMPLOYEE SAYS FIRM WAS UNETHICAL\u000a\u000aA former TRW Inc controller told a Congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in its defense contracts with the government. "It is my contention that the company called TRW is not ever vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW only pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits their financial interests," Larry Eagleye said in testimony at a House Oversight subcommittee hearing. Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor components division in Cleveland. Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did not understand why the Defense Department had taken no action against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it had substantially overcharged the government for military aircraft parts. "In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books and other problems in one of the company's divisions in Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of the federal government on various military aircraft parts," Dingell said. "For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRW inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial engine blade," Dingell said in a statement. Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against TRW last year charging the company with overcharging the government. The Justice Department later joined the suit. "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW, I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management, many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy and ethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's (1984) report to the government," he said. Reuter

VPENTAGON DELAYS PLAN TO BUY EUROPEAN MISSILE\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Army has delayed plans to buy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S. ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters, Defense Department officials said. The Army has been considering buying some British Rapier missiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gap partial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. York Division Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985. Despite recent indications by the service that it intended to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told Reuters a final decision had been suspended because some Army officials favored a more versatile gun-missile combination. The gun-missile combination would open the competition wide to U.S. firms. "The missile option is on hold now and no decision has been made," said one of the Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified. "There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an integrated system of our own," said another official. Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab said, however, that Ronald and Rapier "are not out of the picture by a long shot." There has been strong sentiment in the Army to reject a missile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gun and missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle. Such a move would throw the competition wide open to U.S. firms, including General Electric Co GE>, Boeing Co BA>, FMC Corp FMC> and Martin Marietta Corp ML>. But some Pentagon officials have expressed fears that an "off-the-shelf" gun-missile combination could not be fielded quickly enough. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger canceled the Sgt. York gun, made by Ford Motor Co F> Aerospace and Communications Corp, after the Pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs on the system and then decided it could not shoot down attack helicopters at the proper range. The Army later expanded the division air defense concept, announcing it would divide the system into five different components for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billion dlrs, including a missile and gun-system combination on a tracked vehicle.

VINTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986\u000a\u000aRecord high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration between national and international markets, the OECD said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34 pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in the relative importance of the instruments used in international financing. Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined. The OECD said another striking feature of international capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries, which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing. Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing through the flotation of fixed-interest securities. This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps. Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a rapidly expanding market for euro-equities. A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger debt management policies. Growing integration with national markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on international markets. It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to traditional forms of bank lending. Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas. It said many market participants saw little scope for a further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead. It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided by the market for euro-commercial paper. "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from lower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any major advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would require a significantly broader investor base.

VNYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES\u000a\u000aTrading in energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next five to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing chairman Michel Marks. "Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous period of transition that will last five to 10 years," Marks said, adding that volume will soar, international participation will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil companies, and speculators will grow. Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX. "The priority of the next 10 years is operational efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product development," said Marks. Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that are already planned. Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined products volume could soar to 100,000 contracts a day. Much of the increased activity will come from the international sector, according to Marks. "That's a huge growth area," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign producer countries to foreign independent operators. He said it would be difficult to develop a futures contract based on an internationally traded crude although he previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility. "Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said. Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on an international product rather than an international crude will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract. Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the major oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds, and insurance companies, Marks said. "The commodities markets have become financial markets and should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries," Marks said. He said speculators will increase their share of the energy futures markets in the coming years from the current share of about 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70 pct share.

In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.1 pct in the period to 3.37 mln bpd from 3.44 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.60 mln bpd, up 2.4 pct from 6.44 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.47 mln bpd, up 1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln bpd, down 8.7 pct from 9.18 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 4.11 mln bpd, up 36.9 pct from three mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd, up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said. Reuter

VSECURITIES GROUP FAVORS NEW BANK POWER FREEZE\u000a\u000aThe Securities Industry Association endorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for commercial banks. Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co, told reporters his group, which mainly represents investment banking firms, supported committee members who want the Federal Reserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bank holding companies seeking new powers. "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance pending congressional review," Gerard said. The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan associations and prohibit new nonbank banks. Gerard said the securities association had no position on nonbank banks. The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensive study before changing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial and investment banking activities, Gerard said. Until the study is completed, the Fed should not act on the applications by Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said. The study was likely to show substantial benefits from continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking, he said. Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker Jim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds that invest in securities. "It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax on the saver and investor," Gerard said. In addition, a U.S. tax would drive business from the United States to other countries, he said.

VCOFFEE PRICE DROP NOT AFFECTING COLOMBIA'S DEBT\u000a\u000athe sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect colombia's external credit situation, finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters. "our foreign debt is high, but we can pay, and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us," he said. He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on colombia's financial state, which he described as sound. Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987. The conservative party and the country's largest trade union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following the price drop. Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs. Reuter

VEXCHANGE BANK EXCG> SEES BANK INDUSTRY SHAKEOUT\u000a\u000aOpportunities for medium-sized banks to compete in the face of the increasing centralization of the financial services industry may be dwindling, according to John Rau, president of the Exchange National Bank of Chicago. "We're going to see a continued shaking-out of the banking industry," Rau told Reuters after a speech to securities analysts and investment advisors. Rau said Exchange National Bank has concentrated its resources on financial services for medium-sized Chicago and Midwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-market companies, and sales and trading of financial services. "Most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost consumer deposits for their income. We decided to move our franchise into a less susceptible niche," Rau said. "Nichemanship is a very difficult thing, especially in urban areas where inevitably banking franchises are mass-market oriented," Rau said. "The odds are against other banks doing what we have done." Exchange National Bank is the principal subsidiary of The Exchange International Corp. With total assets of 1.9 billion dlrs, it is Chicago's fifth largest bank. Net income totalled 10.2 mln dlrs or 1.10 dlrs a share in 1986, up from 7.7 mln dlrs or one dlr a share in 1985. Reuter

VIVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED\u000a\u000aIvory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said without elaborating. "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market," he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee. Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate. Reuter

Dlrs in January from 203 mln, revised from 207 mln, in December and 305 mln in January 1986, in a smoothed measurement, the Statistics Department said. Unsmoothed figures show a deficit of 162 mln dlrs for January against 107 mln, revised from 75 mln for December 1986 and 575 mln in January 1986. The smoothed series -- adjusted to iron out random fluctuations -- shows a widening surplus on merchandise trade to 46 mln from a surplus of 33 mln, revised from 43 mln dlrs in December and a 71 mln deficit in the a year ago period. Exports were 905 mln dlrs against 929 mln, revised from 971 mln in December and 816 mln a year earlier, while imports fell to 858 mln from 895 mln, revised from 928 mln in December and 888 mln in January 1986. Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 53 mln dlrs vs 141 mln, revised from 203 mln surplus in December 1986 and a 323 mln deficit a year earlier.

VCHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES\u000a\u000aThe rally Wednesday in U.S. interest rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a three month trading range which signals a bullish chart breakout, financial analysts said. In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts said. "The market is paying more attention to the weakened state of the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery. Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth will be slow. Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production figures also provided some support. "The domestic economies of the major trading partners of the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be forced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodative U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First Options of Chicago. Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices. "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather than translate those into their own currencies and suffer exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments," Michael said. Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from buying by Japanese interests. But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32. "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bonds close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways pattern we've been in for the last three months." Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said. Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still have the April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearby contract is 105-15/32. Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June T-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106." Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed from other technical indicators such as relative strength indexes and short-term momentum indicators. "Without them, sustained strength is in question," Keefe said. Reuter

Dlrs of debt incurred on behalf of farmers under the Meat Price Stabilisation Scheme, Finance Minister Roger Douglas said. Douglas and Agriculture Minister Colin Moyle said in a joint statement the agreement concludes one of the major refinancing arrangements announced in the July 1986 budget, which removed subsidies from the farming sector.

VPRESIDENT REAGAN SAYS ARMS FOR HOSTAGES WAS MISTAKE, ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY\u000a\u000a\u000a

VREAGAN ADMITS IRAN ARMS OPERATION A MISTAKE\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan, fighting to regain public confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal, admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an arms-for-hostages deal and, "It was a mistake." "When it came to managing the NSC (National Security Council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record," Reagan said in a television address to the American people. "I have already begun correcting this," he added in his prepared remarks. Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed contra rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he waited for the truth to come out and admitted, "I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence." He said that a few months ago, he told the American people he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert operation. "My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not," Reagan said. "There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a mistake," he said. Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government. "It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran. "I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan," he said. The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower, said Reagan's "intense compassion" for Americans being held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy. It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, which hatched the operation. Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's recommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, "In fact, I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in even better order." He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress, "especially on foreign and national security policies." He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, was rebuilding the national security staff "with proper management discipline." Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now consisted of new people. He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nominee to head the CIA, "understands the meaning of 'rule of law'". Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which acts as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities. But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- "No ifs, ands, or buts." Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong defense of his Iran policy. In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on terrorism "utterly false." As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union speech, Reagan said that "serious mistakes were made" but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals. By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confident demeanor. He said he took full responsibility for his own actions "and for those of my administration." "As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior," Reagan said. Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies around the world -- "and if we're reading the signals right, even from the Soviets." His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Reuter

VREAGAN SAYS IRAN POLICY RECORDS IMPROPERLY KEPT\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan said improper record keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran arms initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved arms shipments by Israel before or after the fact. In a televised address to the American people Reagan said he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a complaint made by the Tower commission. The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel. "I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when," Reagan said. Reagan added: "Rest assured, there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House)." The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated various laws, including the Arms Export Control Act. Reuter

Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of 408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and New York's close of 410.00/50. Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities, they added. However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60 dlrs, dealers said. On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of 3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778 close. REUTER

VIRAN REPORTS OFFENSIVE AS IRAQ THREATENS AIR RAIDS\u000a\u000aIranian troops are fighting on two widely separated fronts in a new offensive in the mountains of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, Tehran's IRNA news agency said. Baghdad war communiques made no mention of fresh fighting on northern or southern sectors, but a military spokesman threatened a resumption of air raids on Iranian towns. IRNA, monitored by the BBC in London, said Iran had seized several strategic heights in the northern assault, which started on Tuesday. It said at least 2,000 Iraqi troops had been killed, wounded or captured. The offensive is in the Haj Omran area of Kurdistan, scene of fierce fighting in 1983. Tehran radio reported last night that Iranian forces were in control of four mountain areas, bringing several Iraqi towns with troop concentrations within artillery range. In the south, IRNA said, Iranian forces captured several Iraqi defence posts east of Iraq's second city, Basra, in a drive north along the Shatt al-Arab waterway. Today is the end of a two-week-long Iraqi moratorium on air raids declared on condition that Iran stop attacking Iraqi territory and shelling its towns.

VITALIAN PRESIDENT FACES PROBLEMS CHOOSING LEADER\u000a\u000aPresident Francesco Cossiga meets political leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister five times previously and whom the majority Christian Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again. The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing five-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party's president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister. Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, the Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general elections are likely unless agreement can be reached. Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists and the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats. After the consultations, Cossiga will name a prime minister-designate who will try to form a government. REUTER

VUNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE\u000a\u000aAbnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said. It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said. The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months. The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said. The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said. REUTER

VTAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES\u000a\u000aTaiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said. He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production. "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery. "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification," he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright. REUTER

VARGENTINA SEEKS NEW DEBT DEADLINES, OFFICIAL SAYS\u000a\u000aArgentina will tell its creditors it needs an extension of deadlines for payment of capital and interest on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt, Industry and Foreign Trade Secretary Roberto Lavagna told reporters. "We, the developing countries, are going to insist on the application of contingency clauses, to extend deadlines for the payment of capital as well as interest," he said. He said this could bring about what he called a possible automatic capitalisation of those parts of debt interest that could not be paid and even the elimination of a portion of the debt. REUTER

VECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY\u000a\u000aIndonesia heads for general elections in six weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20 years, economists and officials said. The government expects no spillover of "people power" from the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of President Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the coming parliamentary elections is assured. However, Western diplomats said it is the country's deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its stability. Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5 billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas account for 70 pct of export income. The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections, Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay increases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending. The government has also recently increased transport fares and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the second year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8 pct. The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986. Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for almost a third of the 1987/88 budget. A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in 1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year. In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct, the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings. Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its share of new projects being built with overseas money, because it cannot afford even to meet local costs. In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans totalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37 billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and the country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors. A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments. Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are on the way, including two more from the World Bank worth a total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation. U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's fundamental stability. The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has so far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless it is tackled. It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that unless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach what it termed "unacceptable levels." Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of last year, but those considered underemployed number around 35 pct. What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute within Suharto's government, with his Western-trained technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported by the international financial community. But another group supports a protected economy, with more import substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said. The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the dollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and is currently working on a series of measures to further encourage foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector. The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's ability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say. So far, despite three packages of economic measures over the past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by business associates, diplomats and bankers say. Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems. REUTER

VREAGAN SPEECH WINS MIXED REACTION FROM CONGRESS\u000a\u000aRepublicans in Congress hailed President Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid and constructive while Democrats, who control both houses, said Reagan would now have to match his words with action. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes. "But one speech is not enough to rebuild trust." "President Reagan told the American people what they needed to hear, that mistakes were made and he made them," Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said. Reagan, responding to the Tower Commission report criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal, said for the first time the Iran arms policy, and not just its implementation, was a mistake and accepted responsibility for the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels. Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the administration would "remain under a cloud" until several key figures in the scandal, including fired National Security Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John Poindexter, have told "the whole truth." Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as chief of staff, and the replacement of Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC. Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he believed Reagan took the right measure in admitting mistakes without apologising for them. Some House Democrats, including Speaker James Wright of Texas, said earlier they would delay their reaction until tomorrow in order to study the speech overnight and assess its impact. REUTER

VOPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO\u000a\u000aOPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance." He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that." "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they'll help each other," he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date. "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices," he said. REUTER

VECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE\u000a\u000aThe easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency, bond managers and traders said. Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the Japanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese accord to internationalise the yen, they said. The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85 pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added. "The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are only after attractive money," one bond trader said. Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently. Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort to "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing. But the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation. The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by Japanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is strong, he added. Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments, traders said. "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond department. While few foreigners are interested in the secondary market, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer little currency risk, traders said. The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from 180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small. "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the Euroyen market," he said. One trader said that although demand from Japanese investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S. Interest rates decline further. To encourage further international use of the yen, the ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers. Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory. Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be. "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bond manager said. If more financial instruments were available, there might be more trades in yen, he added. Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities, traders said. The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond maturities within a few months. One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the Japanese currency, he said. "If exporters or importers can raise funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the Japanese yen as a settlement currency," he added. The Finance Ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors. "No major market can keep its status without change," he said. REUTER

VTHAILAND REDUCES MAIN RICE CROP PROJECTION\u000a\u000aThailand's main paddy crop is expected to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35 mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said. It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986. It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.

VHK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE\u000a\u000aThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks," one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd WAIA.HK> and James Capel and Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions." Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER

VNEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN\u000a\u000aThe highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said. REUTER

VHAWKE SEES FOUR BILLION DLR BUDGET DEFICIT\u000a\u000aAustralian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating said the government's 1986/87 Budget deficit could hit four billion dlrs against the official forecast of 3.5 billion. Hawke told a Sydney radio station the deficit "may turn out at four billion." He and Keating last week warned that the budget deficit was running above target and vowed sharp decisions on spending in a May 14 economic statement. A four billion dollar Budget deficit would be in line with private economists' forecasts and compares with a 1985/86 shortfall of 5.73 billion dlrs.

VSPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT\u000a\u000aThe Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets. In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13. "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the statement said. Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct. The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged. Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987. Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern. Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control. Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

VJAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME\u000a\u000aJapanese creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations, international financial sources told Reuters. Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month, they said. The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad, the sources said. Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project, the sources said. Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said. There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and perhaps as many as 28, they said. About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country. The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said. The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock. The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad, the sources said. The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans. Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said. The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied. A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries. The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans.

VIRAN REPORTS HEAVY FIGHTING IN IRAQI KURDISTAN\u000a\u000aIran said its troops repulsed heavy Iraqi counter-attacks and continued their advance through the rugged mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan in overnight fighting on the northern war front. Iran launched the new offensive, codenamed Karbala-7, on Tuesday night among the snow-capped peaks of the Haj Omran border area of northeast Iraq. The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the troops "continued their successful advance ... With more thrusts into enemy positions." It said "remnants of Iraqi Brigade 604 was shattered and 200 of its personnel killed or wounded." One battalion of the 25th Division's Third Brigade thrown into counter-attacks today suffered 70 pct losses, the agency added. Some 208 prisoners of war had been taken from the front. IRNA said the Iranian forces backed by heavy artillery fire were continuing to advance. No Iranian casualties were given. The area between Haj Omran and the Kurdish town of Rawandiz some 65 km inside Iraq was the scene of heavy fighting in 1983. Iran has backed dissident Kurds in the area in attacks on government positions and installations in northern Iraq. IRNA said the Iranian forces captured large amounts of munitions in the latest fighting. The Iraqis have made no comment so far on the Kurdistan fighting, or on advances Tehran reported yesterday on the southern war front east of the strategic Iraqi port of Basra. IRNA said today a group of its reporters visited newly-captured areas on the southern front and found the battlefield littered with the bodies of Iraqi soldiers and burnt military equipment. They quoted an Iranian soldier, Hamid Dehqani, as saying heavy rainfall during the past few days "had paralysed the Iraqi enemy from embarking on any action" against the attacking Iranians. IRNA referred to the "Fish Canal" -- the man-made Fish Lake -- made by the Iraqis as a defensive barrier on the eastern side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The agency yesterday said infantry and armour of the Revolutionary Guards had captured strong defences west of the canal in bitter fighting with Iraqi troops. REUTER

VTAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH\u000a\u000aTaiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said. Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4. He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result. Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987. In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics. Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year.

VBANK OF CEYLON TO ADOPT NEW POLICIES\u000a\u000aSri Lanka's largest bank, the government-owned Bank of Ceylon, plans to adopt a more aggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excess liquidity, estimated at some 500 mln rupees, and enlarge the country's export manufacturing base, the bank's new chairman Nimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview. The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to be announced later, he said. Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of Ceylon, the nation's central bank, until January. A Swiss-based non-governmental group, which Sandaratne declined to identify, has agreed in principal to guarantee export credits, he said, but refused to elaborate further. The bank may also consider more actively participating in the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees, or about 70 pct of the total market, he said. Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd. The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operating here have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake in MBSL, Sandaratne said. He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profits for calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln the previous year. The increase was eroded by increased provisions for bad debts, he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mln allotted for general provisions, he added. REUTER

The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions.

VU.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS\u000a\u000aU.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States. "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he told a press conference after three days of talks. "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth." Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year, Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986. He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport, agricultural products and car telephones. He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy.

VJAPANESE CAPITAL INVESTMENT SEEN SLUGGISH IN 1987\u000a\u000aJapanese private plant and equipment investment will grow 0.1 pct in fiscal 1987, starting April 1, from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing sector spending, the Japan Development Bank said. Capital spending by manufacturing industries, hit hard by the rise of the yen, will fall 5.6 pct, a survey said. Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust, it said. The 0.1 pct overall increase compares to the 3.1 pct rise the bank projected for the current fiscal year. In the manufacturing sector, iron and steel companies are the most pessimistic, with an estimated 18.0 pct spending cut. Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will decline by 18 pct and 11.2 pct respectively, the survey said. In the non-manufacturing sector, transport and leasing service industries are expected to increase their spending by 15.7 pct and 10.6 pct, respectively.

VJAPAN RULING PARTY FIXES DATE OF BUDGET HEARING\u000a\u000aJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable. In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14, parliamentary officials said. The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan. Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based. A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to push through the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closely negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I would like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly." The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, is planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual income and corporate tax. The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower House plenary session, political analysts said. The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an unforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the sales tax. REUTER

VGERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT\u000a\u000aThe outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected." The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct. REUTER

VECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS\u000a\u000aPoland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to convert into financial terms," one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation." A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons. "Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy." "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges. Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now," said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs." While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said "The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity." Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners." He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt." Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. "As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

VU.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG\u000a\u000aBritain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show. Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln. For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984. Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday. The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion. In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg. The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said. However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available. REUTER

VFRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY\u000a\u000aThe Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week. This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985. REUTER

VHONG KONG CD MARKET SHUTS DOWN AFTER NEW ISSUE\u000a\u000aThe Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced, bankers said. Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue. Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all major players stopped making markets in existing issues. The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs flooded the market in January. Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed. The speculation depressed local interest rates and unleashed a flood of new issues. But the speculation faded in early February and interest rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate capital market. By late February the market had recovered considerably but Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today. Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new issue circulated. When the deal was launched the major players quickly suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own issues, brokers said. "We just don't know where the market is going," said a European banker. They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10 basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister banks in the Bank of China group. An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the market at that time. But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the present market conditionS, "the timing was just not right." "If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues now, and then the market would be all right," another dealer said. "But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic," he said. "The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals." Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the group has not yet been finalised. "Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the deal," said a dealer. "But there are other considerations such as relationship." He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager. A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new issue. "Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue," he said. Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues. REUTER

VBANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 500 BILLION IN BILLS\u000a\u000aThe Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 500 billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a projected money market surplus, money market traders said. Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in 27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2. The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a 39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14, they said. The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit. Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420 billion yen, mainly due to payment of national annuities, money traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 1,300 yen. REUTER

VHUGHES TOOL HT> SEEKS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER\u000a\u000aHughes Tool Co said its board has appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker International Corp BKO>. Last night, Hughes directors said it would terminate its agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that the Hughes board had determined to be unreasonable. The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at Hughes. Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer. Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on condition that they find a buyer approved by the Department for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their agreement. Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions. Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand, Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree." The company said its board found the consent decree to be unreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed a substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of the combined company, which would have been called Baker Hughes Inc, and would include all of Reed's international assets and its coring and diamond bit assets. Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to sell Reed. The company said the board decision to adopt its own divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker did not accept was unanimous. Reuter

VNO MINES DAMAGE REPORTED AFTER CHILE TREMOR\u000a\u000aA tremor hit northern Chile early today but there were no immediate reports of victims or of damage to the country's vital mining industry, the National Bureau for Emergencies, ONEMI, said. The effects of the tremor at 0620 hrs (0920 GMT) registered four to six degrees on the 12-degree Mercalli scale in Antofagasta, 1,000 km north of Santiago, and five to six degrees in Chuquicamata and Calama, at the centre of Chile's mining region. The tremor was followed by a milder aftershock at 0758 hrs. An ONEMI spokesman said windows had been broken and a number of cornices had fallen off buildings in the worst-hit areas. These effects are described as up to seven degrees on the Mercalli scale. The tremor caused a partial power cut in northern Chile, the spokesman added. Quoting from the latest report from the area, received at 8.37 A.M., He said the effects of the tremor registered two to three degrees on the Mercalli scale in Arica, on the northern border with Peru, and three to four in Copiapo, 700 km north of Santiago.

VEARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING\u000a\u000aOPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

He said while Bethlehem, which has been losing money for several years, does not intend to seek protection from creditors now, it could do so if conditions worsened, particularly if it ran out of cash. But the spokesman said Bethlehem ended 1986 with over 460 mln dlrs in cash on hand, partly due to the sale of assets over the year, and expects to maintain its cash position at around that level through 1987.

VBAKER BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES HT> MERGER\u000a\u000aBaker International corp said it has filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co to complete its proposed merger with Baker. Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by Hughes. Hughes' board had previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures. Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice Department consent decree. Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal. Baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger. Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves. Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs or three pct. Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree. It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary damages it did not name. Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies. Reuter

VSPAIN DEREGULATES BANK DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES\u000a\u000aSpain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a ministry spokesman said. The measure was published today in the Official State Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days. The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public interest." Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year. Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation. REUTER

VUSAIR U> REJECTS TWA TWA> TAKEOVER BID\u000a\u000aUSAir Group Inc said its board has rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers. The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional." USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont. "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests." USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont. The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

VU.S. EXPANSION THREATENED - CONGRESSIONAL REPORT\u000a\u000aThe U.S. economy is facing several serious problems which threaten its continued expansion, according to a Congressional report released today. The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near future. Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation. Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee, which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives. "The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger signals that lie just below the surface," Committee chairman Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement. "A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin ice," the Maryland Democrat said. He said the danger signals included a decline in investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the nation's farmers. Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration forecasts. "The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy," the Republican report said. "The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress is reducing the federal deficit," the Republicans added. Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but also wanted the government to spend more on education, job training, research and development and health care. They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy if this becomes necessary. "There is now substantial concern about the inflationary effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money supply," the Democrat report said. "At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources of capital in American investment markets means that the Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down." "Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy is thus not very encouraging," the Democrats said. The Democrats called on the Administration to be more aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking new initiatives to solve the international debt problem. The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982. Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to increase American productivity including incentives for saving and investment in plant and equipment and development of a better educated work force.
