VBAHIA COCOA REVIEW\u000a\u000aShowers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27. Reuter

aVTALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA BAC> EQUITY OFFER\u000a\u000aBankAmerica Corp is not under pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor performance, banking analysts said. Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments on a large portion of its foreign debt. The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon, after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news. Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the First Interstate Bancorp I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term. BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as one of the major factors leading the First Interstate withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9. A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated. "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do," said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval. "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith. Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they have to show the market an improved financial outlook. Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible preferred stock would encompass at least part of it. Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group. Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to ease over the coming weeks. Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co. He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show up in the current quarter. With other major banks standing to lose even more than BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.

aVDEAN FOODS DF> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS\u000a\u000aDean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts. In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share. Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year. He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share. Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share. In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone." President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co. Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago. He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I.

aVBANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT\u000a\u000aVenezuela and its bank advisory committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last February, bankers said. They declined to disclose details because two or three representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval of their senior management for the new terms. The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today, the bankers said. "A number of details have still to be finalized, but the broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest rates are in place," one senior banker said. The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at 1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year. It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed - and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new investment in Venezuela. The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been going on intermittently for several months, follows the announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel. And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package, including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20. While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental, bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil. Reuter

aVTOWER REPORT DIMINISHES REAGAN'S HOPES OF REBOUND\u000a\u000aThe Tower Commission report, which says President Reagan was ignorant about much of the Iran arms deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political dominance in Washington, political analysts said. "This is certification of incompetence," private political analyst Stephen Hess told Reuters in commenting on the Tower report made public today. "It's as if he went before a professional licensing board and was denied credentials." In one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman John Tower, a longtime Reagan supporter and former Republican senator from Texas, told a press conference, "The president clearly did not understand the nature of this operation." The report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in Washington that Reagan is not in full command of the government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared by a board of the Republican president's own choosing. The three-member panel made up of Tower, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism from a Congress controlled by the Democratic party. "We're falling by our own hand," said one Republican political strategist. "What can we say except 'we're sorry, we won't do it again'?" The strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988 presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said the report was like "an anvil falling on us." Hess, with the Brookings Institution public policy study group, said the report is the final blow to Reagan's hopes of regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with Congress, the press and the Washington bureaucracy. The report may also undermine the standing of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping their own skirts clean than supporting the president. "They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences," it said. White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases. Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged for allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran initiative and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosure process. Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous brain tumor in December, had already resigned for health reasons last month. "This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of being heroes," Tower told reporters. While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers, including command of the armed forces and the right to veto legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly with Congress controlled by the Democrats. The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair. Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms deal with Iran became public last November, his personal popularity is still relatively high. A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was doing a good job as president. American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a Democrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public. "In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite by appealing directly to the public," Schneider said. Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised address next week. But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting a dramatic turnaround. "The White House has to avoid building expectations that cannot be met," said the strategist, who requested anonymity. "They have to recognize there is no quick fix." Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity has not always translated into public backing for his policies. They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control of the Senate to the Democrats. Reuter

aVJANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, REALTY GROUP SAYS\u000a\u000aSales of previously owned homes dropped 14.5 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.

Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items where such actions will not endanger our national security, and eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority over the licensing process," Cranston said. "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65 to 70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more rational...licensing process will boost exports." U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc countries access to technology that could further their military capabilities. "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said. "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told reporters.

Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1 mln shares changing hands by late afternoon. "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs, maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer, announced before the opening today, expires March 25. "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready. She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials. "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang, analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would." Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management. Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. SVM> or Rollins Inc ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested. ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes. Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system. Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed. Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter. Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice. Reuter

aVBRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY\u000a\u000ainflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis. Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate. But within a year the plan has all but collapsed. "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank economist said. The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln. Reuter

aVU.S. DATA POINT TO CAPITAL SPENDING SLOWDOWN\u000a\u000aA surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy in the first quarter of 1987, economists said. With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector, falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy. But they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital investment. "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the 19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to tax reform than we thought." The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in office and computing equipment orders. Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws. "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said. Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws, economists said. November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported 0.9 pct. But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused by more than tax reform. "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater than the actual gains that took place in November and December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year." "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said. "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland Montagu's Maude said. Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of January's report, given that other reports have reflected strength. But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51 pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in December. He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December. "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said. "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added. Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will have to ease to ensure global growth." Reuter

aVARGENTINA COULD SUSPEND DEBT PAYMENTS - DEPUTY\u000a\u000aArgentina could suspend payments on its foreign debt if creditor banks reject a 2.15 billion dlr loan request to meet 1987 growth targets, ruling Radical Party Deputy Raul Baglini told a local radio station. "Argentina does not discard the use of (a moratorium) if the negotiations do not produce a result that guarantees the growth of the country," he added. Baglini, an observer at Argentina's negotiations in New York with the steering committee for its 320 creditors banks, told the Radio del Plata in a telephone interview that the banks were divided on the loan request. Baglini said that as a result, today's scheduled second day of talks had been postponed. He said Argentina was prepared to follow the example of Brazil, which last week declared a moratorium on interest payments of a large portion of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt. Argentina's prime objective in renegotiating the debt was to maintain growth, which has been targeted at four pct in 1987, Baglini said. "Debtor nations should not have to take from their own pockets, that is their commercial balance, to meet interest payments," he added. Reuter

aVKEY U.S. TAX WRITERS SEEK ESTATE TAX CURBS\u000a\u000aThe chairmen and senior Republican members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991. If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions after Sept 26, 1987. The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn), Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen Bob Packwood (R-Ore). In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less than 300 mln dlrs for the same years. He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax entirely when they die." He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as is currently estimated." He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the modification of the provision in accordance with its intended purpose." Reuter

aVQUEBECOR PQB> HEAD SEES NEW VENTURES LIKELY\u000a\u000aQuebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new daily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president Pierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview. The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company Donohue Inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper mill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said. "I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This is not definite but i think we will," he said, adding that he plans to announce a decision early next week. Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily newspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the second-largest circulation paper in Canada. A new daily would give Montreal its second English- language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North America, analysts have said. Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six months. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new venture would have the support of major advertisers. Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55 pct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of two major Canadian companies who are interested in the project but has not decided whether he would take partners in the newspaper venture. He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures. "It would be the possibility of doing something else in the short term," Peladeau said. Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc BPCL.L> does not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects. Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake in Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the govvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British printing acquiring the other 49 pct. "In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of newsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to print the paper," Peladeau said. "When I lived that, I said to myself...next time we'll be ready." Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint capacity however, is already committed to other buyers. Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year and Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes. Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49 pct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's 540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will have to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build another mill to meet their demands . He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be on stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the government. Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures with Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in France or in the U.S., where the company owns two large printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire. He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would provide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are prevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in France or the U.S. Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of two groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada, Peladeau said. He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers in two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the province. Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its listing on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock Exchange listing. Reuter

aVIRAN ANNOUNCES END OF MAJOR OFFENSIVE IN GULF WAR\u000a\u000aIran announced tonight that its major offensive against Iraq in the Gulf war had ended after dealing savage blows against the Baghdad government. The Iranian news agency IRNA, in a report received in London, said the operation code-named Karbala-5 launched into Iraq on January 9 was now over. It quoted a joint statewment by the Iranian Army and Revolutionary Guards Corps as saying that their forces had "dealt one of the severest blows on the Iraqi war machine in the history of the Iraq-imposed war." The statement by the Iranian High Command appeared to herald the close of an assault on the port city of Basra in southern Iraq. "The operation was launched at a time when the Baghdad government was spreading extensive propaganda on the resistance power of its army...," said the statement quoted by IRNA. It claimed massive victories in the seven-week offensive and called on supporters of Baghdad to "come to their senses" and discontinue support for what it called the tottering regime in Iraq. Iran said its forces had "liberated" 155 square kilometers of enemy-occupied territory during the 1987 offensive and taken over islands, townships, rivers and part of a road leading into Basra. The Iranian forces "are in full control of these areas," the statement said. It said 81 Iraqi brigades and battalions were totally destroyed, along with 700 tanks and 1,500 other vehicles. The victory list also included 80 warplanes downed, 250 anti- aircraft guns and 400 pieces of military hardware destroyed and the seizure of 220 tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Reuter

aVU.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS\u000a\u000aU.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said. The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier. A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday. He said that natural float had been "acting a bit strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week. The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday. The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts. For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country. The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days. However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact. During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions. On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks. The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole. For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks. Reuter

aVAMERICAN EXPRESS AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF\u000a\u000aAmerican Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock. American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend. American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume. American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity. Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes. At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts. Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions. Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff. Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year. "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very profitable securities firm." Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset. But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market. Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past. "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization," said Eckenfelder. Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally. "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis. "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily into the international arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way," he said. Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business. "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company," he said. Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter

Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln dlrs in the year earlier. In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln dlrs to 230 mln dlrs. Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a more diversified organization through four major acquisitions last year. Products from the new acquisitions and other new product introductions are expected to enable it to return to profitability, it said.

aVGAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH\u000a\u000aA study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said. Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters. GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee. The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March. The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program. If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less. GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said. But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said. The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it. Reuter

aVVenezuela seeks 'flexibility' from banks-azpurua\u000a\u000avenezuela is seeking a 'constructive and flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister manuel azpurua told a press conference. He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's 13-bank advisory committee except to say, "they are progressing." Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate according to its own interest. Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over libor, azpurua said only, "that is good news." According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct Venezuela wants. Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment schedule, and debt capitalization schemes. Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in public and private debt principal this year. It was due to amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420 mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector. He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank loans. The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that no direct commitment was likely on new loans. "debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of financing is guaranteed," azpurua said. However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt payments, "because circumstances change too quickly." At the same time, he said the government is presently studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries. The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the central bank. Reuter

The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon. The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs.

Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2 pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct). A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said. The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par pricing.

aVOPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS\u000a\u000aOPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said. "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets. "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices. But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December. "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again," he added. David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems. "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens," Mizrahi said. But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd." Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output. "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York. But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production. "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

aVU.S. REGULATOR CLOSES BANKS IN TEXAS, LOUISIANA\u000a\u000aThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said three troubled banks in Texas and Louisiana were merged with healthy financial institutions. The FDIC said it subsidized the merger of Central Bank and Trust Co, Glenmora, La., with the healthy Peoples Bank and Trust Co, Natchitoches, La., after state regulators notified it that Central was in danger of failing. Central had assets of 28.3 mln dlrs. The FDIC said the deposits of the failed Farmers State Bank, Hart, Tex., were assumed by Hale County State Bank, Plainview, Tex. Farmers, with 9.6 mln dlrs in assets, was closed by Texas bank regulators. The deposits of the failed First National Bank of Crosby, Crosby, Tex., with total assets of 8.2 mln dlrs, were assumed by Central Bancshares of the South Inc, Birmingham, Ala., after First National was closed by federal bank regulators, the FDIC said. The number of federally insured banks to fail so far this year now totals 32, the FDIC said. Reuter

aVBANKS EXPRESS GRAVE CONCERN ON BRAZIL DEBT MOVES\u000a\u000aBrazil's 14-bank advisory committee expressed "grave concern" to chief debt negotiator Antonio Padua de Seixas over the country's suspension of interest payments, according to a telex from committee chairman Citibank to creditor banks worldwide. Bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger and frustration on the committee over Brazil's unilateral move last Friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines. Seixas, director of the Brazilian central bank's foreign debt department, met the full panel on Tuesday and Wednesday. Seixas, who met again this morning with senior Citibank executive William Rhodes and representatives from committee vice-chairmen Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc, told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits. The telex could be sent to creditors as early as today, bankers said. Despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans for Brazilian finance minister Dilson Funaro to meet commercial bankers during his trip to Washington on Friday and Saturday. Funaro will be explaining Brazil's actions to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus before travelling to Europe at the weekend. Meanwhile, bankers were to hear in New York this afternoon what impact Brazil's hard line would have on Argentina, with an initial presentation from Argentine Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. Argentina has threatened to emulate Brazil's payments moratorium if the banks do not grant its request. Reuter

aVLNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987\u000a\u000aLiquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said. Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year. "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said. Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern BNI>, has expressed no interest. Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment," Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said. Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987. A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said. In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added. Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand. Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values. Reuter

aVU.S. FARM CREDIT RESCUE BILL SEEN BEFORE EASTER\u000a\u000aThe chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its regulator do not ask for help by then. "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you, before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said. Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said. Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid. Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA, as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all its capital and needs federal government help. However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action, he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed. But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify aid is needed, it should request help informally. "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said. Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years. While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts. "A significant number of banks and associations in the most economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer extraordinary losses," Beesley said. Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay loans. The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year. FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders. "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington said. Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation of the system into a centralized national lender, to de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions. But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors. Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent could be developed without Congressional legislation. Reuter

aVREPORT COULD BE FINAL BLOW FOR REGAN\u000a\u000aThe Tower Commission's scathing comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure, but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top officials was less clear. Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels first emerged last November. But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been muted until the release of the Tower Commission report. "Their obligation was to give the president their full support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the president," the report said after a three-month probe. "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program. They protected the record as to their own positions on this issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the president from the consequences of his personal commitment to freeing the hostages." The report saved some of its most scathing language for Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy. "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought to extend this control to the national security adviser," said the report. Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower Commission's findings next week. With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn the spotlight on their future. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally, told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said people who had not served the president well should step aside, but he did not specify who should go. "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the president, you don't serve the president well, then you should move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate next year, said. One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not be the only White House official to leave in the near future. Reuter

aVSWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS\u000a\u000aSwitzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances," the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said. REUTER

aVU.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally." Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process," the aide to Lyng said. "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight," said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm, basic, factual economics." Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

aVU.S. TREASURY PART OF ARGENTINE BRIDGE LOAN\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Treasury said it was willing to participate with several other industrial countries in providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to Argentina. The Treasury announcecement did not name the other countries nor the amount of financing the United States was willing to supply. Argentina announced a wage and price freeze on Wednesday night and is negotiating with New York bankers for about 2.15 billion dlrs in new loans and other financing. "Our willingness to participate in this multilateral short-term financing indicates our support for Argentina's economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable balance of payments position," the Treassury statement said. In announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, Argentine officials said the country needed "a more serene climate" to carry out structural changes in the economy. But Argentina did not suspend interest payments on its foreign debts, as neighboring Brazil did last week. The Treasury said the U.S. share of bridge financing for Argentina would come from its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The one-page statement noted the International Monetary Fund expressed confidence in Argentina's economic policies and prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for it on February 18. "Argentina is expected to qualify for IMF balance-of-payments financing which would enable Argentina to repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation of its economic program," the statement said. The latest Argentine action marked the second time in less than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze to restrain inflation. The debt talks in New York are being headed by Argentine Finance Minister Mario Brodersohn and are expected to last for several days. Along with new financing, Argentina reportedly wants lower interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of the money is loaned in Argentina.

aVJURY FINDS FOR DOW DOW> IN BIRTH DEFECT CASE\u000a\u000aDow Chemical Co's DOW> Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose mother took the drug during pregnancy. The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the drug caused birth defects. Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany. It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about 1,150 plaintiffs. In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of this case by the full Court of Appeals. Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict. At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He said about 300 lawsuits are pending. Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

aVAGENCY VOTES TO END LOCAL NUCLEAR PLANT VETO\u000a\u000aThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants, which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial plants in New York and New Hampshire. The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation standards of its own. Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island, N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules. They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants. A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting the utilties'investments than protecting public safety. An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan. In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency evacuation planning.

The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today. "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush trader said. "But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month," he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added. Reuter

aVFED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY\u000a\u000aLatest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said. "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to today." Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday. This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added. Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said. "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous." "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon. A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week. Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln. For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period. "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier. Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said. "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein." "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one. After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16. Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy. "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing." Reuter

aVJAPAN TO TRY TO OPEN MARKET TO U.S. CAR PARTS\u000a\u000aJapan has pledged to try to increase its purchase of U.S. car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases, the Commerce Department said. U.S. negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade. Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of U.S.-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases, a Commerce department official said. He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders. The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that "statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers." It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985, U.S. firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market. reuter

aVFRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES\u000a\u000aFrance's right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988. "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago," said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year." "The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained," he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands. "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. "But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed," he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE, Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added. Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.

Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall decline for the month. Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities, gasoline and vegetables fell. The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down 0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs. REUTER

The 116-foot rocket lifted off at 1805 local time (2305 GMT) and placed in orbit a 1,850 pound Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to replace an identical one that was destroyed last May when a Delta rocket exploded after liftoff.

"We'll have both our weather eyes open again," said Thomas Pyke, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which owns and operates the satellite. The smooth launching came after two delays in as many days. The first was caused by a fuel leak and the second by powerful crosswinds.

aVITALIAN COALITION MEETS AS GOVERNMENT CRISIS LOOMS\u000a\u000aLeaders of Italy's five coalition parties have agreed to meet today to try to settle their differences which are mainly between Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's Socialist Party and the majority Christian Democrats. Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani said Craxi told him he would announce his resignation next week, allowing negotiations on a new government leader. The conservative Christian Democrats demanded the meeting after Craxi said a pact agreed during a government crisis last August, under which he was to hand over the prime minister's job next month, was unlikely to be fulfilled. Political sources said the Christian Democrats are likely to leave the coalition, which also includes Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals, unless they get the prime minister's job. They said Craxi's plans to resign show he has decided to stick to the pact but talks on a leader, a government program and sharing of ministries will not be easy. They said there is dissent among the partners and that Forlani has been trying to mediate to avoid a crisis. They said the five are likely to begin talks tomorrow on whether formation of a new government is feasible or early elections are inevitable. Elections are not due until 1988. REUTER

aVN.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH\u000a\u000aMonetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said. The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement. The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, Russell said. Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September. Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year. "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers, including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN EYEING FOREIGN STOCKS\u000a\u000aJapanese life insurers, trust banks and corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the U.S. Bond market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the U.S., Britain, France and Hong Kong, fund managers said. After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years, Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments, they said. Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said. Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year, but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months. Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added. This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said. "The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years," said Eugene Atkinson, managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity, enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added. However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling. They will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said. Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S. Treasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse, manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities. There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added. Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S. Equity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S. Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months. Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations, he added. Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies. Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West Germany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said. Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks, he added. One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in U.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies. The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European bonds, he said. Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew Sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan. "Last week was the busiest week we had," he said. Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms, fund managers said. Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc, they said. Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability, they added. Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany, particularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts, are concerned about the recent dollar fall. Australia also poses some risks due to currency values, they added. REUTER

aVJAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES\u000a\u000aJapan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said. They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct. The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added. REUTER

aVAUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS\u000a\u000aDomestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. "The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said. "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time," he said. "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment." Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane," he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. "The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88," Keating said. "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," he said. REUTER

aVMANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS\u000a\u000aThe Philippines will offer its commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness as an alternative to cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters yesterday the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing." Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country"s 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The documents said peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines" debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments. "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received." "We don"t believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms.

aVPRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS\u000a\u000aTalks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

aVBRITISH CONSERVATIVES AHEAD OF LABOUR IN NEW POLLS\u000a\u000aBritain"s ruling Conservatives have enlarged their lead over the opposition Labour Party, according to results of two opinion polls released on Saturday. A Market Opinion Research International (MORI) poll conducted for The Sunday Times showed the Conservatives with a six point lead, while a poll by Telephone Surveys Limited for The Sunday Express found them to be four points ahead. The Sunday Express poll is the first conducted since the Social Democratic Party scored an upset victory on Thursday in a parliamentary by-election in the former Labour stronghold of Greenwich, near London. The MORI poll, conducted in the six days leading up to the by-election, showed the Conservatives with 41 pct of the vote, Labour with 35 pct and the Alliance of Social Democrats and Liberals with 21 pct. The Sunday Express said its poll, conducted on Friday, found the Conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote, Labour with 31.9 pct and the Alliance with 31.4 pct. A Harris poll published in The Observer newspaper last Sunday gave the Conservatives only a two-point lead over Labour. In that survey, the Conservatives had the support of 39 pct of the voters, Labour 37 pct and the Alliance 23 pct. REUTER

aVINDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW\u000a\u000aIndonesia"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia"s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain," the report says. "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels." Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. REUTER

aVKUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS\u000a\u000aKuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting." He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices." Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body"s members. Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April." But he expected the situation would later improve. REUTER

aVINDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE\u000a\u000aIndonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report. To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September. But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy. "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports," the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic performance. It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves." "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy," the report says. Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies. Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports. The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s," the report notes. Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April. But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry." "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture," the report states. Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs. A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said. REUTER

aVINDIAN BUDGET COMES IN FOR WIDE CRITICISM\u000a\u000aOpposition politicians, businessmen and newspapers criticised India"s newly unveiled 1987/88 budget and large projected deficit of around 57 billion rupees. They said the budget failed to provide incentives for economic growth and merely tinkered with tax reform. But few politicians were prepared to criticise a sharp rise in defence expenditure in the Hindu-majority nation where playing on fear of aggression by Moslem Pakistan has proved a vote winner. The Indian Express, the country"s biggest selling paper, said: "The defence cow has never been holier." The Sunday Mail newspaper branded the budget "shamelessly political." It said in a front page commentary the "budget is bad for growth, bad for prices, bad for the stock market and neutral in respect of everything else." Businessmen polled by Reuters said the budget had done little for them. Gandhi announced small increases in poverty alleviation and education outlays but he ordered a hold-down on current expenditure in an attempt to rein in the budget deficit. He told ministries to curb spending and promised a review of money-losing public sector industries. Gandhi lowered import tariffs on some computer parts but otherwise did little to extended the economic liberalisation policy launched two years ago. Reaction in Bombay, India"s business capital, was generally unfavourable. Businessmen and economists said the budget had no proposals for closing the 1987/88 budget deficit. It also failed to boost industrial investment and productivity needed to lift real economic growth above the five pct a year envisaged by the 1985-90 development plan. Nalin Vissanji, President of the Indian Merchants Chambers of Commerce said the budget gave no incentives to the capital market and had not fulfilled a government pledge to remove surtax on corporate income. Shares on The Bombay Stock Exchange, India"s biggest, fell in a post-budget session yesterday but brokers welcomed Gandhi"s proposal to set up a regulatory board for the securities industry. The exchange was shaken last year by several scandals and trading was suspended several times. Brokers said trading volume may increase with the change in capital gains tax on stock sales. Stockholders can now sell shares after one year instead of three years without incurring capital gains tax. Stock Exchange President Ramdas Dalal said yesterday the fall in share prices after the budget came as profits were taken and he expected to the market to firm in days to come. REUTER

aVQATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88\u000a\u000aThe Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

aVGULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS\u000a\u000aGulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region." In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said. REUTER

aVSAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance." Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market." Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing. REUTER

aVCOFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY\u000a\u000aThe International Coffee Organization (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said. The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September, they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said. Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.

aVFEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Economy continued to expand in February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report. The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. But production remained vigorous, with more than three times as many members reporting it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually resumed production. The same number of members reported inventories were higher as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter." The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. REUTER

It forecast end-1987 stocks at around 290,000 tonnes. The main suppliers in 1986 were Australia (44 pct), the U.S. (29 pct), Canada (12 pct), Argentina (8 pct) and Saudi Arabia (5 pct). REUTER

aVZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA\u000a\u000aZambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said. "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

Wladyslaw Baka, head of Poland's National Bank, told the official news agency PAP yesterday the talks were a step towards possible fresh credits or easier terms. "Much attention was given to the Polish delegation and the talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of understanding for Poland's difficult economic position," PAP quoted Baka as saying. Baka said he stressed Poland would meet its financial obligations to the U.S., "but not in a short time, and not without major changes in the Polish economy as well as a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners." Since Poland rejoined the IMF last June, after a 36-year absence, IMF and World Bank teams have visited Warsaw on fact-finding missions on at least three occasions.

Indonesia bought 162,500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986, the report said. The embassy estimated Indonesia's calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 1.8 mln tonnes, against a government estimate of 1.99 mln. It said that Indonesia's move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived. The report said, "The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers. "However, there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops." REUTER

aVEC MINISTERS CONSIDER BIG AGRICULTURE PRICE CUTS\u000a\u000aEuropean Community (EC) agriculture ministers meet later today to consider a package of deep cuts in prices and subsidies after a week marked by strong protests by European farmers, Community officials said. The common target for the farmers' wrath is the EC's Brussels Commission, which for the fourth year running has called for radical changes in the price support system. EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen says huge food surpluses, which have alienated international trade partners and pushed the Community to the edge of bankruptcy, demand such action. With Community warehouses stocked with some 16 mln tonnes of unwanted cereals, over one mln tonnes of butter and huge stocks of wine and olive oil, Andriessen says bluntly the days of open-ended price guarantees must end. EC agriculture ministers try to fix the guaranteed prices paid to Community farmers before an April 1 deadline for the new marketing year, an increasingly difficult task as EC members cut funds and demand greater budget discipline. Andriessen has proposed a freeze for most prices, coupled with reductions in other support mechanisms, which could lead to price cuts of as much as eight pct for some products. A producer's right to sell into EC warehouses at a fixed guaranteed price when he finds no real market outlet is to be scaled back so it applies only in exceptional cases. The latest proposals are designed to keep expenditure on agriculture virtually stable. EC farm policies now swallow two-thirds of an annual budget of about 36 billion European currency units (Ecu) and are mainly responsible for an expected shortfall this year of about five billion Ecus. The most contentious aspects of the package are a new oils and fats tax and a change in the "green" exchange rate system, which translates EC farm prices into national currencies. The tax, of up to 330 Ecus per tonne, would be levied on imported and domestically produced oilseeds, but could trigger a fresh trade dispute with the United States, which provides the EC with the bulk of its soybeans. It would increase the cost of margarines and low-fat products in an attempt to increase both olive oil and butter consumption. West Germany has flatly rejected green rate changes, which would cause a fall in prices for producers as countries with weak and strong currencies were brought more into line. REUTER

The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747 family, he said. The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet to 28, he said. Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will announce a decision on engine purchases later this year. He said they are United Technologies Corp UTX> unit Pratt^M and Whitney>, General Electric Co GE> and Britain's Rolls-Royce^M Ltd>.

The 400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said. The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel saving, he said.

aVSTRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS NEW ZEALAND\u000a\u000aAn earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas, officials and seismologists said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas. The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually isolated. A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges in the area had been damaged. No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud slip. Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes, the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were followed by a series of aftershocks. The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions in the northeast of the North Island. Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more than a week. Police said many districts lost power supplies and telephone links. Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water behind the Matahina hydro-electric dam, 32 kilometres above Whakatane on the Rangitaiki river.

aVPHILIPPINES HEADS CONFIDENTLY INTO DEBT TALKS\u000a\u000aPhilippine Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin starts negotiations with the country's 12-bank advisory committee in New York tomorrow, buoyed by an economy on the mend and political stability one year after President Corazon Aquino took power, central bank officials said. The country now has foreign debt totalling 27.8 billion dlrs and faces debt repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs due between January 1987 and December 1992. Manila also hopes to tack on another 5.8 billion dlrs, rescheduled in a 1985 accord, to any new agreement, the officials said. Chile's 15-1/2 year rescheduling accord at one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and Venezuala's 21 billion dlr package at 7/8 point over LIBOR portend well for the Philippines, despite Brazil's repayment suspension last week, the officials said. Manila, which has not made any principal repayments since 1983, wants terms better than the 20-year repayments at 13/16 percentage point over LIBOR offered in October to Mexico in a 77 billion dlr rescue. Ongpin wants 5/8 point over the benchmark rate, which is currently hovering around 6-1/2 pct. The banks are said to be firm on the 1-1/8 points offered when the last round of negotiations collapsed on November 7. Ongpin said every 1/16 point over LIBOR meant an additional 5.1 mln dlrs in annual interest payments. One banker said banks were wary of repeating a Mexico-type accord, which some 70 small creditor banks are still refusing to endorse five months after it was signed. In Manila's case, about 40 pct of the 15 billion dlrs outstanding to commercial banks is owed to the 12 large banks on the advisory committee, while about 180 smaller banks have average exposures of 20 mln dlrs each.

aVSAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD\u000a\u000aSaudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp XON>, Mobil Corp MOB>, Texaco Inc TX> and Chevron Corp CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

aVINDONESIAN PALM OIL OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RISE\u000a\u000aIndonesia's palm oil output is expected to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector. The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in 1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln in 1985. The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes. A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985. "More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes," the report said. The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year. Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added. REUTER

aVINDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN\u000a\u000aIndonesia's exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said. The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86. In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags. The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation. Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988. Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000 tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987. The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985. The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans. The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants. Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags. Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123,000 tonnes in 1986. Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.

aVSINGAPORE EXCHANGE SEEKING NASDAQ/LONDON LINK\u000a\u000aThe Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System, banking sources said. The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end of this month. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local financial support for the plan existed. Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling a gap when no trading takes place. A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start of three-centre trading to determine investor interest. The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and transfer information among the different time zones, but some details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank director said. Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market liquidity and communication links to the other three centres. But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong, Toyko and Australia, he said. On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ), modelled on NASDAQ. At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd (SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small firms have said they plan to seek listings soon. Market sources expect the next few companies listed will also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said. SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times. In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial 1.87 dlrs to a Friday close of 2.32 after a 2.80 high. So far more than 900,000 shares have traded. REUTER

aVGERMAN EUROBOND MARKET EXPECTS BREATHING SPACE\u000a\u000aAfter an onslaught of new paper, fewer mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said. Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today. "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said. Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks, including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank. Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks, from 3.6 billion in January. The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very best addresses were having to accept higher coupons. "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you can give a good coupon," another manager said. But even some government borrowers were not getting the best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more readily under other conditions. Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone, bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows. Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2 pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price. A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price. Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the 10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said. The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which they say is too inflexible. Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the next calendar period to schedule the bond again. Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system. The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be completely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would give that up," one banking analyst said. "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system," the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the volume of new issues themselves. The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through the euromarket, he said. For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank sacrificing its present calendar system. Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to the carnival holiday. Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday. In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon. REUTER

Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770 billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research and development, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year. An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January, were the major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.

aVTHAI AIRWAYS INTERNATIONAL TO ALMOST DOUBLE FLEET\u000a\u000aThai Airways International plans to expand its fleet to 58 from 30 aircraft by 1995, company officials said. Thamnoon Wanglee, vice-president for finance, told a weekend marketing conference Thai would finance the expansion by borrowing, but he did not give details. He said the airline planned to reduce its yen borrowing to 36.4 pct of overall debt by September 1992. It is currently 64.3 pct of overall debt. He said dollar borrowing should rise to 56.2 pct of overall debt in the same period, compared to 15.7 pct now. Other company officials said the state-owned airline had no plans to go private. They said the airline is studying a government proposal for it to merge with Thai Airways Company, the state-owned domestic carrier. A report presented to the conference showed the airline expects passenger sales revenue to be 13 pct higher in 1987 than in 1986. This follows a 20 pct jump in passenger sales revenue in the past four months.

aVIRAQ DEFERS PAYMENTS ON 500 MLN DLR EUROLOAN\u000a\u000aIraq has secured agreement to defer outstanding payments on a 500 mln dlr syndicated euroloan following five months of negotiations with creditor banks. Banking sources said the rescheduling is part of Iraq's continuing effort to defer payments of foreign debt as its economy comes under strain from the Gulf War and soft world oil prices. Iraq informed the 37 banks in the loan syndicate last September it could not meet the remaining four principal repayments totalling 285 mln dlrs, and missed the first of these for 71.25 mln due on September 29. The 500 mln dlr credit, under the lead management of Paris-based Union de Banques Arabes et Francaises (UBAF), has a five-year maturity and a margin of one percentage point over London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Banking sources said the agreement now worked out goes some way to meeting creditor bank demands that at least part of the first missing instalment of 71.25 mln dlrs be paid and not deferred. One quarter or 17.8 mln dlrs will be paid on signature of the accord, expected in late March, with the remainder in three more instalments to be made every six months. The remaining three principal instalments - originally due in March 1987, September 1987 and March 1988 - will each be deferred for two years from the due date, banking sources said. The margin for the loan remains unchanged and no penalty interest is being imposed, the sources added. Bank reaction to Iraq's rescheduling request has been one of resignation, with many bankers seeing little alternative for Baghdad's economic planners. Iraq is estimated to have foreign debt of about 50 billion dlrs, although about half is thought to be in the form of loans from its Gulf Arab allies, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The 500 mln dlr credit is in the name of the state-owned Rafidain Bank. The only other major eurocredit, a 500 mln dlr deal under the agency of Gulf International Bank, was signed in October, 1985 and is still in a two year grace period. The bulk of Iraq's commercial debt - excluding loans by its allies in the Gulf War - is in the form of trade financing. But Rafidain bank stopped paying debt due on letters of credit last March and a series of negotiations with banks and western government export credit agencies has been underway. Some banks have agreed to a three-year deferrment of obligations due on letters of credit. REUTER

aVJAPAN PLANS MORE FLEXIBLE CORPORATE BOND ISSUES\u000a\u000aJapanese securities houses will issue new corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said. Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues, they said. "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said. Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now, the securities managers said. Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end, and accept issue requests during the month, they said. Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market, securities managers said. Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>. The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms, securities sources said. The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds. Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic, they said. The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market, securities house managers said. The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said. The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said. The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system, more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process, securities sources said. It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and for deregulation of private placements, they said. Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in 1988, the sources said. REUTER

aVJAPAN BUYS SOME 95,000 TONNES SOYBEANS FROM CHINA\u000a\u000aJapanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said. The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment. Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium. Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said. Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said. In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

aVINDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE\u000a\u000aSoybean imports are forecast to rise to 425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated 300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture. It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target. Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86. Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said. Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988. China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said. "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them," it said. Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.

aVJAPANESE BANKS COOL ON NIGERIAN DEBT TALKS\u000a\u000aJapanese banks are expected to give Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks, banking sources said. "We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling," said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank. A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt, bankers said. The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans. "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation," said another Japanese bank official. He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details. Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria, representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions, banking sources said. They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here, the sources added. "Otherwise, our response will be very negative," the senior official said. Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal. Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems. Barclays Bank plc BCS.L> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem, the banking sources said.

aVJAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said. They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988. "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration, which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori, professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters. "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer," Shiratori said. Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes. Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies," he told a meeting of government and party leaders. "If the party discipline is broken, I would like to see punishment considered." "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it," Shiratori said. "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging," he said. Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April, involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and assemblies at all levels. But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP, the political analysts added. Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of the sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision. "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct. "A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said. Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University, thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills," he said. The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House. To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign, Sato said. "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said. REUTER

aVBLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER\u000a\u000aThousands of black mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers. About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations. Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines. It was not stated how the union would "seize control." The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families. The crowd, one of the largest to attend a meeting since South Africa declared a state of emergency last June, also shouted approval of a proposal to work closely with anti-apartheid movements such as the United Democratic Front (UDF) which claims two mln members. They also shouted their support for a demand that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela be released. REUTER

The ministry said the fresh allocation, for the February 27-July 7 shipment period, is the third under a maximum 5.5 mln tonne overall quota that Thailand obtained from the EC for calendar 1987. It said the quota allocation was based on a national tapioca pellet stock of 4.34 mln tonnes surveyed last week, up from 3.05 mln in mid-January. REUTER

aVATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS\u000a\u000aMine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period. REUTER

aVSAN MIGUEL BOARD APPOINTMENT MAY MEAN CHANGES\u000a\u000aDisagreement over management of San Miguel Corp> (SMC) may follow the Philippine government's appointment of a well-known banker to the SMC board, investment analysts said. They told Reuters the presence of United Coconut Planters Bank> (UCPB) president Ramon Sy to the board of SMC may mean changes in SMC management, which for decades was controlled by the family of its president, Andres Soriano. Sy was appointed by a government commission that controls 51 pct of San Miguel's stock, after another nominee resigned. The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) holds six seats on the 15-member SMC board, which represent 33.13 mln sequestered shares. The stocks were seized on suspicion that they were owned by Eduardo Cojuangco, then chairman of UCPB and San Miguel. He was a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos, and he left the country after Marcos's fall. Before the seizure, Soriano led a 3.3 billion peso bid for the shares, paying UCPB a 500 mln peso deposit. The bid valued the shares at about 100 pesos. They traded at 93 pesos today, down from 95.50 at Friday's close. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters on Saturday that Sy would definitely sit on the SMC board despite the objections of some directors associated with Soriano. "I don't think there is a conflict of interest as such," he said. "I was potentially concerned with seeing a situation where you have a contentious atmosphere on the board. But Sy has assured (the government) that he does not intend to behave in a contentious manner," Ongpin added. The Soriano group cited conflict of interest in opposing Sy's directorship. Its lawyer said in a letter to the PCGG that a pending suit seeking forfeiture of SMC's 500 mln peso deposit and major undisclosed damages against the brewery represented a clear conflict. UCPB, however, sought board representation before Sy's appointment, petitioning the PCGG "so that the interests of the owners of the 33 mln shares would be adequately protected." Investment analysts polled by Reuters said the UCPB had a right to a slot on the SMC board as trustee for coconut farmers who claim ownership of the disputed shares. The analysts said Sy, backed by the government, would probably suggest replacements for PCGG nominees expected to resign soon in keeping with a new law prohibiting government officials from working for private companies. SMC's annual election is scheduled for May. A UCPB spokesman declined to comment, saying it was up to the PCGG to decide whom to appoint. One analyst said objections were understandable from the family that founded the company 97 years ago. "It is a natural instinct of self-preservation for Soriano," he said. SMC posted a net income of 448.8 mln pesos in 1985 on net sales of 10.99 billion pesos against 422.3 mln in 1984 on sales of 10.36 billion. REUTER

aVESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED\u000a\u000aThe combined profits of Japan's major corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research Institute of Economics said. The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November. Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said. Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said. It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook. Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said. The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88. REUTER

aVINDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION\u000a\u000aPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal 1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty, economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters. The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is 56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87. The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86. Economists pointed out that the government itself had expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87 economic survey report published last week. Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for 1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he said. But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously. They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees. Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices. Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by 15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of 1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86 period. Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects, after bad weather last year, may strain prices further. Economists said the deficit would also cause the government to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion. No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes, which will discourage savings, economists said. Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency notes to cover the deficit. Brokers said stock market investors have started selling long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the budget that reduces the holding period required to claim exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three. Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, "There is uncertainty in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure." But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the scene. "Just now there is acute nervousness in the market," he said. Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market on a long-term basis. New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

aVJAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION\u000a\u000aThe Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said. The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank said. Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln. The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the bank said. But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD rates. The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln. The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23. New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum, respectively. Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same. REUTER

aVU.K. CONFIRMS JANUARY STERLING M3 RISE\u000a\u000aThe Bank of England said the broad measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December. The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1 pct in the year to December. The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said. The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two weks ago. In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year. The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also confirmed provisional figures issued in February. The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the Bank said. The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg. Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank private sector's holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1 billion stg. There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.

aVEXCO BUYS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKER\u000a\u000aExco International Plc>, a subsidiary of British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc BCOM.L>, said it had agreed in principle to buy an 80 pct stake in RMJ Holdings Corp> for about 79 mln dlrs. Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder. Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years. RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers. It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies. Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs. B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs. The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled. Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its SMS> unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community. RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion. It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day.

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTERITY MEASURES IN HUNGARY\u000a\u000aHungary is to embark on a new series of austerity measures to tackle a budget deficit which tripled last year after quadrupling in 1985. The target deficit in the 1987 budget approved by Parliament last December was 43.8 billion forints. But Zoltan Boesze, chief of the Finance Ministry's budget financing division, told Reuters the government now saw this as too high and had decided "quite severe" measures were needed. "All the organizations of economic management have been charged with elaborating further (savings) measures," he said. Asked if these measures were being taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boesze said: "The Fund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results, and of course the Fund would support these efforts." IMF teams spent several weeks in Budapest late last year. Boesze said preliminary figures showed that Hungary's state budget deficit rose to a preliminary 47 billion forints last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. The economy overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forints because of poor performance by state firms, which needed subsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency. The exact extent and nature of savings are still under discussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest budget item -- must definitely fall, Boesze said. Subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low consumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. Parliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints. "I think that in 1987 it is quite impossible to keep up the former situation and we will be obliged to reduce subsidies," Boesze said. "The central administration must be hard. ... If we are not hard then we will not be successful." Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve provisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and 800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. "I believe these reserves should not be used at all," he said. Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic product, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct. The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real wages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax penalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct. This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail price inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1. About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices. Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant cuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made this difficult. But he added: "I think ultimately we will be able to make curtailments in subsidies in this area as well." He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the beginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and value added tax. The IMF supports these aims. Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an attempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms. Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be unemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is being tightened and firms may fire workers more easily. Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state by firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to shed labour. He gave no exact figures. Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible for drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped the law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct. After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single budget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved for 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion). Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986, Boesze said. Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while trade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years earlier. Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct by credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10 pct by the issue of domestic state bonds. Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian economists in a speech this month that the country's economy was in a "very difficult" situation, but not in crisis. There would have to be a turnround with tangible results this year, however, and borrowing must be used more effectively. "Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous," Berecz said.

aVDIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN\u000a\u000aJapanese consumers hesitated about buying the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper. "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee. Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen. Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March, industry sources said. DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality. This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines. Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier. "Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said. DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a profitable niche. Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market, industry analysts said. They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per year. Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year. REUTER

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ITALIAN BOOM\u000a\u000aItaly's strong economic revival has led some observers to talk of miracles and created euphoria in some quarters about future growth prospects, but many Italian experts warn that the current wave of optimism is excessive. "I think all this foreign interest in the so-called Italian miracle is really exaggerated...Foreign observers always oscillate in the case of Italy between complete pessimism and unwarranted optimism," says Luigi Spaventa, one of Italy's leading economists and a professor at Rome University. According to Spaventa, these violent swings of mood have been occurring for the last 15 years, with Italy one minute seen as the "bad boy of Europe" and unable to raise a dollar and the next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration, "I think there's a lot of exaggeration...Once it used to be the underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign newspapers flocked to Italy to study this. That was another story about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark room." Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists here, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly the dramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial enterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable. Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A., FIAT.M> and ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the major state industries are back in the black after years of losses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of payments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some experts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's fifth largest economy have also boosted optimism. Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it feels to be its second-rate status among the major industrialised countries. Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this status after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an agreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada attend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned managing the international monetary system. But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems still facing its economy, economists and industrialists say. "We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy," warns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti. He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed cause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on the problems still remaining rather than those already solved. The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment and a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most worrying problems, experts say. The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion lire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral again, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss university in Rome. Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a decade in September 1984 and by January this year was running at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee international competiveness, economists and industrialists say. And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last October according to the latest official data. Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million people seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged between 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at 17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product (GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct in 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to check rising unemployment. Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw materials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs. This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last year, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985. But economists say the improvement owes little to any structural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal of the trend in costs could have serious consequences. If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top industrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket operating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality information about their activities, economists say. Italy has no controls on insider trading. The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements controls -- a European Community directive calls for these to be dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less blinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating procedures, economists say. "Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I doubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks which would allow me to do that," says Spaventa. REUTER

aVJAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS\u000a\u000aJapan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese government official said. "But we are also frustrated." The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. "It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. "We have no leverage," one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market. The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

He said they are Pratt and Whitney> and General Electric Co GE>, a unit of United Technologies Corp UTX>, and Britain's Rolls-Royce Ltd>.

The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel saving, he said.

aVEC OPENS ANTI-DUMPING ENQUIRY INTO SOVIET MERCURY\u000a\u000aThe European Community Commission said it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices. The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry. According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace. The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said. The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs. The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority. REUTER

aVMANILA SAID TO OFFER DEBT BONDS TO BANKS\u000a\u000aThe Philippines will offer commercial bank creditors an innovative pricing plan that will make debt payments through certificates of indebtedness instead of cash, the authoritative Business Day newspaper said. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin told reporters Saturday that the alternative proposal is designed to avoid an impasse when debt rescheduling talks reopen in New York on Tuesday. He did not give details but said, "It is a very useful alternative and in the end will permit the banks to say that they achieved their pricing target and will likewise permit the Philippines to say exactly the same thing." Quoting negotiation documents to be presented to the country's 12-bank advisory committee, Business Day said the debt certificates will carry maturities of five or six years. It said the certificates will be classified as zero-coupon bonds or promissory notes with no interest but priced at a considerable discount from their redemption price. It said the debt bonds will entitle holder banks to a guaranteed return on both interest and principal since no payment of any kind is made until the bond matures. It said a bank can sell the bonds on the secondary bond market for either dlrs or pesos depending on its requirement. The peso proceeds can be invested in selected industries under the Philippines' debt/equity program. Ongpin said Manila is sticking to its demand of a spread of 5/8 percentage points over London interbank offered Rates (LIBOR) for restructuring 3.6 billion dlrs of debt repayments. "(The proposal) will give the banks a choice of 5/8ths or the alternative," Ongpin said. "Our representatives have gone to Washington to the (International Monetary) Fund, the (World) Bank, the Fed (Federal Reserve Board) and the (U.S.) Treasury to brief them in advance on this alternative and it has generally been positively received." "We don't believe that there is going to be a problem on the accounting side," Ongpin said. "We have run this alternative proposal to the accounting firms. Neither have the government regulators indicated that there will be a problem." Reuter

Argentina is currently negotiating terms with the steering committee for its creditor banks that will allow it to meet four pct economic growth targets in 1987. It has also asked for a reduction in interest rates and fresh credit. Brodersohn said the growth targets were not negotiable, but Argentina did not want to follow Brazil in suspending payments on its foreign debt. He said Argentina was seeking 2.15 billion dlrs credit to meet the targets, adding that the banks' attitude had improved following Brazil's decision. The United States and a group of other industrial nations on Thursday granted Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge loan. Brodersohn held talks in New York with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker and International Monetary Fund (IMF) head Michel Camdessus. Reuter

aVMANILA OFFICIALS SPLIT OVER DEBT STRATEGY\u000a\u000aA rift has occured among Philippine officials over debt talks opening tomorrow in New York with Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod accusing the chief negotiator of softening his stand to gain a quick agreement. Monsod told Reuters Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin had decided not to insist on Manila's creditor banks pledging to fund half of a projected 1988/92 financing gap of seven billion dlrs. "He (Ongpin) wants to finish the negotiations as fast as possible. I'm saying that's very short-sighted," Monsod said. Monsod said any pricing agreement on rescheduling 3.6 billion dlrs of the Philippines' total foreign debt of 27.8 billion dlrs would ignore a looming 14 billion dlr net resource transfer in the same period. Manila is seeking a spread of 5/8 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR). Monsod said, "Right now we are saying to the banks, let's share the financing burden." Ongpin said last month the country's consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors had endorsed a growth facility to bridge the funding gap. He said the government and the consultative group would meet annually to gauge financing needs for each year. The aid donors and commercial bank creditors would then be asked to finance any gap on a shared basis. He told reporters on Saturday it would be unwise to try to pin the banks down on Monsod's proposed growth facility. Ongpin acknowledged there was a dispute over tactics. "Secretary Monsod and I get along famously," he said. "She talks and I listen but I don't necessarily agree." Monsod said a firm commitment from the banks on bridging the financing gap would have aided the government's pump-priming program and 1987/92 medium-term development plan. She said if private sector investment continued to be held back by the fear of a balance of payments crisis and rising interest rates, the country would fail to achieve its gross national product (GNP) growth target of an average 6.5 pct over the next six years. "If you don't get those seven billion dlrs there is no plan. How can there be a program if there is no finance?" she said, adding Ongpin's stand was not good for the economy. "It (Ongpin's stand) is going to make it much more difficult for the economy to attain its growth targets," Monsod said. "Considering what the Philippine negotiating team is going to press for there is absolutely no reason why they should not be able to come back (from New York) in a day," she said. Monsod, the government's chief economic planner, stressed Manila's policy was growth before debt. She said if the banks refused to lend the new money, the Philippines should copy Brazil's action last week in freezing all debt repayments. "If the banks do not cooperate by lending you back some of the money that you are sending abroad, then of course you have an option," Monsod said. "You just don't send it abroad. You do a Brazil."

aVTAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS\u000a\u000aTaiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said. Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year. Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper. "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially," he said. The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners. A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles. Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

aVRHONE-POULENC TO LAUNCH INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES\u000a\u000aFrench state-owned chemicals group Rhone-Poulenc RHON.PA> said it will increase its capital with a 2.5 billion franc issue of preferential investment certificates on March 9. Company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said 500 mln francs of the issue will be placed in the U.S. Details of the issue will be announced by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur on March 6. The group, due to be privatised at an unspecified date, said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue its development strategy and make further acquisitions. Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the Paris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The group's capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs. Fourtou, speaking at a news conference, did not give details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987. He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial investment program of around five billion francs, and research spending of about 3.5 billion francs. Rhone-Poulenc spent 5.5 billion francs on acquisitions last year. "Chemistry is on the move and we face opportunities that must be seized," Fourtou said. REUTER

aVHUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS\u000a\u000aHutchison Whampoa Ltd HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK> to Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

aVBALLADUR EXPECTS IMPROVED FEBRUARY INFLATION DATA\u000a\u000aThe French inflation rate is expected to show a substantial improvement in February after January's very high 0.9 pct monthly rate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said. He told a French television interviewer that half of the high January rise, which took year on year inflation that month to three pct, was due to higher oil prices. "Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecast for price rises this year is two and a half pct," he said. Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target, which the government had initially set at two pct for this year, should not affect wage expectations for this year. "There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy," he said, referring to the government's aim of holding public sector wage increases to three pct this year. Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in 1985. REUTER

aVFEBRUARY U.S. PURCHASING MANAGER INDEX FALLS\u000a\u000aThe U.S. economy continued to expand in February, but at a slower pace than in January which saw a spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said in a report. The Association's composite survey index declined to 51.9 pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator was over 50 pct. A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth rate in new orders and production slowed in February. However, production remained vigorous as more than three times as many members reported it better rather than worse. Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel X> gradually resumed production. An equal number of members reported inventories were higher and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August 1984. For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February, but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for a respectable first quarter." The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. Reuter

aVFUNARO SAYS BRAZIL NEEDS MORE, FASTER FINANCE\u000a\u000aBrazil would not have suspended payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more and faster financing from official lending agencies, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. He said he would not seek more money from the International Monetary Fund to which Brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and said Brazil's problems could not be solved by IMF intervention. "It's a question of why the official lending agencies don't finance a little bit more quickly and easily," Funaro told reporters at the Brazilian Embassy. Asked if Brazil would have continued making payments of monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied, "Yes, because our country did not receive financing from these agencies." Asked how long the payment suspension would last, Funaro said "It all depends on what kind of financing we are going to receive from the other side." Brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs, stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks. Funaro said Brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the World Bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans. He said the net transfer was hurting the country's continued growth and capacity to import goods. "Something is wrong with the system. Some mechanism has to be found to finance a country like Brazil," Funaro said. He did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he would like to see "automatic" official lending when needed so that Brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves, now reported to be below four billion dlrs. Funaro said Brazil had the world's third-largest trade surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight billion dlrs. But he said that without increased and faster lending from official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export earnings to finance development and imports and also service its debt. "We must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and internal adjustment," Funaro said. He complained that official lending agencies had imposed tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available. Funaro said U.S officials understand his position "but they don't like it." Later he left Washington for a tour of Europe and debt discussions with officials in Britain, West Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. Brazil's central cank President Francisco Gros said he sent a telex to creditor banks Friday to clarify confusion over Brazil's request that banks expedite procedures for renewal of short-term interbank credit and trade credit lines.

aVAMERICAN EXPRESS AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS\u000a\u000aAmerican Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition. In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters. American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place. Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public. There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said. American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74. It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees. Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year. Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm. Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986. American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs. To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. "(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities. Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president. The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company. Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition. Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage. Reuter

aVSWISS HAVE NET GAIN IN 1985 GOVERNMENT FINANCES\u000a\u000aSwitzerland recorded last year its first overall surplus in government finances since 1974, ending with a net gain worth 905 mln Swiss francs, the Finance Ministry said. The surplus, including cash transactions and long-term investments, contrasted with the 1985 shortfall of 1.06 billion francs and the 297 mln franc deficit proposed in the 1986 budget. All categories of revenues were higher than forecast, and expenditures were 433 mln francs under forecast. The Finance Ministry said expenditures totalled 23.18 billion francs against 22.88 billion in 1985 and the 23.61 billion proposed in the original 1986 budget. Tax receipts, at 25.11 billion, were well above the 1985 figure of 22.19 billion and the forecast for 1986 of 23.71 billion. This left a surplus on cash transactions totalling 1.94 billion francs against a forecast 102 mln and the 1985 deficit of 696 mln. Income and wealth taxes ended 749 mln francs above forecast, 378 mln of which came from higher than expected receipts on the stamp duty on financial market transactions. Taxes on comsumption brought in 638 mln francs more than planned and other taxes 16 mln francs more, the ministry said. The ministry said the improvement in the overall account reflected years of efforts by the government and parliament to introduce saving and the acceptance by people of necessary tax increases. But economic factors, including the low rate of inflation, the weak dollar, falling interest rates and low oil prices were also important factors. A spokesman for the ministry said the government had used its improved cash position to retire about one billion francs of government debt, which accounted for the difference between the 1.94 billion surplus on cash transactions and the 905 mln franc overall surplus.

aVAPPLE COMPUTER AAPL> UPGRADES MACINTOSH LINE\u000a\u000aApple Computer Inc today will announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the business market. The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than earlier models. The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Apple says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus, goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features. The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs. Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for about 2,200 dlrs. Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld Conference in Los Angeles. Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the expanding market for science and engineering workstations. John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer, declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users. "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for most people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a real power product for revenue." Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers but expected the new products to do well. "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation," he told Reuters. "The graphics interface on the Mac products is significantly better than anything IBM has to date." International Business Machines is expected to announce updated personal computers this spring. The Mac II uses the new Motorola 68020 microprocessor, an "open architecture" that allows for the addition of numerous peripheral devices, a built-in hard disk and one megabyte of memory, expandable to eight megabytes. It can be equipped with a 12-inch monochrome or a 13-inch color monitor. In a demonstration of its speed and power, company executives said they thought the Mac II would push the development of software for Apple computers in new directions that could include sophisticated video editing, electronic mail systems and sound reproduction suitable for studio use. The Mac II can be upgraded so that its monitor displays 256 colors or shades of gray. The Mac SE is built around the 68000 microprocessor and will be shipped with one megabyte RAM, expandable to four megabytes, and a nine-inch monochrome screen. Both new computers have two optional keyboards, a new feature in the Apple line of products. Reuter

LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the necessity of doing so. The trust said "If the working interest owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties paid to the trust would be significant." Royalties from the properties are the trust's only source of income. The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices. It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have actually increased in physical amount. The cost estimates reflect prices and costs only through September 30. The trust said using the September figures, the engineers determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs. Usingprices received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would have been about 87 mln dlrs. LL and E noted that there has been some weakening in prices since January. The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986, as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations. If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations. Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs. This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business. Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant. Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet. E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said. "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future," said Idsal. William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division, will be chief executive officer of the new company. The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions. The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended. Reuter

aVPAKISTAN COTTON OUTPUT REACHES 7.7 MLN BALES\u000a\u000aPakistan cotton production during the current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375 pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said. Official sources said Pakistan was likely to use 3.4 mln bales of cotton during the current financial year ending June after 2.96 mln in 1985/86 and 2.70 mln in 1984/85. They said consumption would increase due to a rise in demand for cotton yarn in domestic markets and abroad. Pakistan produced 540 mln kilos of yarn in fiscal year 1985/86 and exported 157 mln. The State-owned cotton export corporation was likely to export 3.8 mln bales of cotton during the current fiscal year compared with 3.86 mln last year, cotton traders said. The traders said there would be 1.3 mln bales of cotton carryover this fiscal year compared with just over a mln bales last year. Reuter

aVIMPERIAL CHEMICAL IMP> FORMS NEW UNIT\u000a\u000aImperial Chemical Industries PLC said it is forming a new U.S. pharmaceuticals unit called ICI Pharma. Combined sales of Imperial's existing Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit and the new ICI Pharma are projected to be 1.1 billion dlrs in 1990, the company said. Stuart had 1986 sales of 582 mln dlrs. Imperial said it plans to introduce several new drugs, including diprivan, an anaesthetic, and zestril, a heart drug, over the next three years. ICI Pharma and Stuart will operate as separate units of ICI Pharmaceuticals Group, it said. Stuart Pharmaceuticals and ICI Pharma will have 1987 sales of approximately 700 mln dlrs, about 450 mln dlrs from the new ICI Pharma and 250 mln dlrs from Stuart, officials said. The combined sales force of about 900 sales people, split about equally between the two units, will be slightly larger than the existing sales force at Stuart. Regulatory approval for the annesthetic diprivan is expected in late 1987, while zestril, a hypertension and heart drug, should be approved in mid or late 1988, company officials said. Approval for oth new drugs, including, statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, is not expected until 1989 and 1990, the officials said. Reuter

aVU.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS\u000a\u000aThe U.S. asset-backed debt securities market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers. "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group. BankAmerica Corp's BAC> Bank of America unit last week issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors. The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of 200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's RPT> RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager. However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to market last year than were the RepublicBank securities. "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the first public offering of credit card receivables because we used a grantor trust vehicle," he said. In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest in the trust, analysts explained. The Bank of America certificates were issued by California Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single purpose, investment bankers pointed out. The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in 1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries when First Boston priced the deal," one said. However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway. The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone. "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18 months and then interest and principal payments for the remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed. Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals that were brought to market late last year. The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said. Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted. In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc. Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and 450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc MACK>, via Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc. The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs. Reuter

aVREAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING\u000a\u000aAfter a week that left his presidency shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal. Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker, whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon. Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency. White House officials are checking to see how much support Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said. Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," the Kansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in some difficulty." Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority by Baker. Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only after months of congressional probes into the affair. "He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen. and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. "He is a victim." Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week With David Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is in trouble." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates. When asked on the syndicated television program, "John McLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed, the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn't bet any money on it. "I think this report hurts that," Nunn said. "It indicates that the National Security Council had policy-type influence over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into that with Mr. Gates. Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief of staff. Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the botched handling of the Iran arms sale. The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on the White House" since it was first revealed last November that profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government. The two other victims of the scandal are former National Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have refused to testify. Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy. That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership, a record low, and a third believed he should consider resignation. After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen. John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television address this week to respond to the criticisms of his presidency. Reuter

aVCHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987\u000a\u000aCheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings." Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

aVU.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED BORROWING FACILTIES\u000a\u000aThe Bank of England said it had offered borrowing facilities to those discount houses wishing to use them at 1430 GMT. The Bank also said it provided the money market 456 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session bringing its total help so far today to 493 mln stg. This compares with its forecast of a shortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg. The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising 41 mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct 361 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 10-3/4 pct. Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently used the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does not want to see an early reduction in U.K. Base lending rates. The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at rates of interest higher than its prevailing money market dealing rates. REUTER

aVBRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE\u000a\u000aBrazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said, adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks." The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'sate of inflation. Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt. "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service, because we cannot service all that," he said. "I really think we have to change the old rules." Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis, Funaro said "We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the banks have some limits." "It is a political discussion from our point of view," he said. Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk to the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from the governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks." He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution. In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982. "You must open these mechanisms," he said. He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves. Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "because we can't stay as we were the last few years." "I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable. Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987. Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months. Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world, Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only one pct. "The solution is linked with growth, not recession," he said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt. Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments, as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

aVTAIWAN TO SEEK HIGHER TEXTILE EXPORTS TO U.S.\u000a\u000aA Taiwan mission will leave next week for Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign Trade official said. Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988, based on the value of 1985 exports. The official said the pact was unfair because the United States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until 1991. He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of the surging value of the Taiwan dollar. Reuter

For the first nine months of its fiscal 1987 year ended November 30, 1986, Nuclear Data reported a loss of almost nine mln dlrs or 4.98 dlrs a share on revenues of 32.6 mln dlrs. Nuclear Data cited improvement in printed circuit board sales and said it is confident it will obtain replacement financing. In other action, Nuclear Data said it set up a 1.25 mln dlrs reserve to cover the revaluation of certain domestic medical inventory and the redirection of its U.S. medical sales efforts. The reserve was taken to offset a decline in the U.S. dollar against the Danish Kroner and other factors adversely affecting sales of its Danish manufactured medical products in the U.S. market, Nuclear Data said.

aVU.K. SAYS HAS NO ROLE IN BRAZIL MORATORIUM TALKS\u000a\u000aU.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves, a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors. He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support. Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks. Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis. Funaro, accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros, is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month. Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy, arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy. Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth. Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies. He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks have some limits.... It's a political discussion from our point of view." Funaro said on Friday that his talks with U.S. Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial contact. He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request. After travelling this week to France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks. REUTER

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs. Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs. The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover. Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom. The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today. The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock. The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret. In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs. Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said. Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover. The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said. The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said. Last week, the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs. Reuter

If the latest French requests are accepted as expected, this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25,500 tonnes. The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries. Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

aVSTUDY GROUP URGES INCREASED U.S. OIL RESERVES\u000a\u000aA study group said the United States should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry. U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a private group, also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil. But the group did not strongly back either option, saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. Reuter

aVCARBIDE UK> LOOKS TO ACQUISITIONS FOR GROWTH\u000a\u000aUnion Carbide Corp is looking to acquisitions and joint ventures to aid its chemicals and plastics growth, according the H.W. Lichtenberger, president of Chemicals and Plastics. Describing this as a major departure in the company's approach to commercial development, he told the annual new business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth markets we've identified." Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger explained. He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link up profitably with someone who is already there." He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the same way. Reuter

aVCANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK\u000a\u000aThe Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said. The deadline for a final determination is March 7. U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market. Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

aVEC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY\u000a\u000aEuropean Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis." But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter

aVCME PLANS RULE CHANGES TIGHTENING S/P TRADING\u000a\u000aDirectors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index futures pit, an exchange executive said. The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade for their own account. But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called "front-running", where traders enter orders for their own account before executing orders for their customers. Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days. In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed said the special committee will also make suggestions about a possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P 500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit. Melamed said directors are likely to approve the recommendations of the special committee because "most actions of the board are in line with committee recommendations." CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for approval. If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request, a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said. Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on before the recommendations from the special committee are made "it will confuse the issue." Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict dual trading. Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most exchanges. "It's a question of the integrity of the person you do business with," Wolff said. Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in chaotic futures trading pits. "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult for a broker to function because of his errors," said John Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago. "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved," he said. Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said. "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michael said. An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said. Even figuring what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such brokerage can be lucrative. Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the brokerage business, Michael said. Reuter

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI. WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future. WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management, Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI shareholders. It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues -- selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try -- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did not produce any agreements or understandings. WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate at this time." WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch and other shareholders. Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22 dlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based on AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share bid, which the company rejected.

aVICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE\u000a\u000aTalks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said. No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said. A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said. Reuter

aVSEC STAFF ADVISES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST WPPSS\u000a\u000aThe staff of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to recommend that the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) be charged with securities fraud in connection with its July 1983 default on 2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a WPPSS official told Reuters. WPPSS attorney Ron English said the system was advised by SEC staff attorneys that the five SEC commissioners would be asked to charge WPPSS in connection with its official statements about its plans to build its No. 3 and No. 4 nuclear power plants in the Pacific Northwest at the time it was selling the bonds. English, in a telephone interview, said the SEC staff planned to allege that WPPSS had overstated the demand for power in the region and had understated the cost of the plants, which were to built with the bonds' proceeds. English denied the allegations. He said WPPSS had made no public forecasts of power demand in connection with the bond sale and had never understated the cost of the plants. "We at all times told the public everything we knew about the costs," he said. English said WPPSS had no indication when the SEC might meet on the staff's recommendations. The SEC, as a matter of policy, never comments on its enforcement activities. The SEC's WPPSS investigation began in late 1983 and the agency's slow pace on the probe has been publicly criticized on several occasions since then by Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the House panel responsible for the SEC's budget and operations. Of the five nuclear plants originally envisioned by WPPSS, one has been completed, two remain under construction, and two others--those for which the defaulted bonds were sold-- have been terminated.

aVVERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER\u000a\u000aVersatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie said. In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded. The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work." Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment. Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992. The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way. The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic. Reuter

aVCUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED\u000a\u000aCuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said. Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts. The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes. Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said. Reuter

aVNYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE\u000a\u000aThe New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide. On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman. "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman. Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained. The expanded program "will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts. Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction. Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials. When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading." The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman. Reuter

aVTALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL VIA>\u000a\u000aA bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator. Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20 days from the day we mail," said the source. The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises. Redstone was not available for comment. Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win. The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow. Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock. Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share. Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs. Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest. Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue. Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares. A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs.

aVU.S. ELECTRONIC SALES FLAT IN 1986\u000a\u000aU.S. electronic companies' sales last year totalled 226.5 billion dlrs, slightly below the 228.7 billion dlrs reported in 1985, the American Electronic Association said. Despite the decline, the fourth-quarter total of 61.1 billion dlrs matched the industry record for the same period of 1984, the AEA said. AEA senior vice president Ralph Thomson said that, although the 1986 sales trend was mostly positive with an upturn at the end of the year, the industry is waiting early 1987 figures before trying to forecast the future. "Many of our companies, including the semiconductor sector, are still being impacted by the enormous and growing trade deficit with Japan," he said. Fourth-quarter orders totalled 60 billion dlrs for a 3.1 pct increase over the same quarter of 1985. December sales were 22.2 billion dlrs, up 2.8 pct from the same month in 1985. The association represents more than 2,800 firms that produce electronic goods and services. Reuter

aVTALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS\u000a\u000aCanada's decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said. U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually. The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties. The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population." But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world. The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports. A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized. The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcasting and films. It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage. Reuter

aVUAL UAL> UNIT ATTACKED ON MINORITY HIRING\u000a\u000aUAL Inc's United Airlines was accused in a congressional hearing today of locking blacks out of key jobs, but the company said it had made tremendous progress in minority hiring. The issue was aired during a hearing of a House Government Operations subcommittee whose chairman, Rep. Cardiss Collins, called the treatment of minorities by the country's largest airline "pathetic." "It strikes me odd," said the Illinois Democrat, "that the number of white women pilots is more than double that of black pilots, and that white women are more fairly represented in upper management." United has been under a court order since 1976 to increase its minority employment.

aVICI ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES\u000a\u000aImperial Chemical Industries PLC, the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson. "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not." ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive." Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

aVFUNARO REJECTS UK SUGGESTION OF IMF BRAZIL PLAN\u000a\u000aBrazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very big recession." "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said. "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "But if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then that means nothing is helping to find a solution." Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks. "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my country," he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis. "We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said, "We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens." Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year. "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said. "What we have to offer is our cooperation." Reuter

aVU.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION\u000a\u000aAll major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said. Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim Miller, president of NAWG said. "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter

aVPESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI AMI> BID\u000a\u000aChicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said. Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and appropriate at this time." "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group. "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment," Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. "I think it's much more doable," he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter

He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful misapplication. Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a former president, was convicted on three of four counts of securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as the firms were able to show proof of their solvency. Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a 1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30. Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his convictions. All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of Home State funds through investments with ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt and triggered the collapse of Home State. On March 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all of the state's privately-insured savings and loan companies and they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with other companies which had federal deposit insurance.

aVBRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE\u000a\u000aBrazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said. U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said, adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks." The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983, however. Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions. Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis, "Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors," central bank president Francisco Gros said. Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs. Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments. Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton. Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around 8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K. The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan. The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'rate of inflation. Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs. Reuter

There had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued. Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday. Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share. analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday. Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon, Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said. Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S. courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three dlrs per share. Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents on the transaction to be made public later this week. Reuter

aVKIDDER UNIT SELLS CMOS, INCLUDING FLOATERS\u000a\u000aKidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes, including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches. Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11 pct cap. Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody. For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the 11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar, the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said. Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12. The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer said. The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of 1.8097 times three-month LIBOR. Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the 500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160 basis points over comparable Treasuries. The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's. Reuter

aVYEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX\u000a\u000aU.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture. In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC. "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market," Yeutter said. Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT. He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine, and closer in price to expensive European butter. "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said. "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks)," he said.

A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week. Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens. The Greek statement today said, "Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government." "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey," it said.

aVFRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS\u000a\u000aFrench industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was "increasingly ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets." "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months," it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries." This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly," it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost," one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue," it said. REUTER

aVSEC PROBES 1986 TRE TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT\u000a\u000aThe federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp, attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said. During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE. It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired. In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock. Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing. The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws. One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering. A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe. The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers. A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe. The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time. "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid, he said. A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added: "We had nothing to do with TRE." As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities. Reuter

aVREGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY\u000a\u000aLast week's White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker, kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker. "This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House. Reuter

aVUSSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS\u000a\u000aGrain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports. "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks. An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the (wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation. One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before mid-year, if it was "competitively priced." Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading organization, told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced. "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they should find ways to do it." Reuter

aVCONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING DOWN THREE PCT IN JAN\u000a\u000aContracting for future construction work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of 236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said. The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding construction was largely responsible for the month's setback from December's higher level. Residential building eased three pct in January, while contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report. Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to 43.1 billion. Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for 1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending authority. Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the reason for the gain, the report said. Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

aVEC MINISTERS BID TO SAVE DAIRY ACCORD\u000a\u000aEuropean Community (EC) farm ministers were fighting hard early today to prevent a deal on cutting overflowing milk production from turning sour before trying to agree widescale reforms in other surplus sectors. Meanwhile, protests from angry European farmers over successive attempts to scale down unwanted Community food production appeared to be gathering strength. In the northeastern Spanish city of Saragossa thousands of Spanish farmers battled with police during a march to demand a better deal from Brussels. The farmers traded stones for tear gas and rubber pellets and occupied local government buildings while in the southern city of Malaga, citrus growers dumped more 20 tonnes of lemons on the streets in protest at EC duties. Towards the end of last week, about 10,000 angry West German farmers marched through the streets of Hanover burning effigies of Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle while in France pig-farmers barricaded roads in protest at falling prices. Europe's 12 mln farmers are furious over plans by the European Commission to cut subsidised prices and severely limit farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted food into public stores at high guaranteed EC prices. In the toughest-ever proposals for the annual price review, at which EC ministers set the levels of subsidies, Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen has included measures that could result in price cuts for some products of up to 11 pct. The plans form part of an on-going campaign to reform surplus-creating farm policies that have become a political embarrassment at home and commercial flash-point abroad and threatened to leave the Community with no cash for other areas. Andriessen's latest package comes only months after a decision to cut dairy production by 9.5 pct over two years and to slash beef prices by around 10 pct. That decision, agreed in outline last December after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations, was hailed as the most significant step yet in the reform offensive, but has since run into difficulties over the fine print. West Germany and Ireland are objecting to the new rules governing the sales of surplus butter into cold stores, but the Commission is loathe to abandon its position as the accord has been used as the inspiration for Andriessen's latest package. Ministers failed yesterday to overcome the problem, and resumed negotiations in a bid to finalise the details before starting the price review which is confidently predicted to last many months. EC farm spending currently swallows two thirds of an overall annual budget of around 40 billion dlrs and is almost entirely blamed for a projected budget shortfall later this year of some 5.7 billion dlrs.

Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people, up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier. Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-worst level set last December. Record male unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986. Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal to the record level marked in April, August, September and December last year. January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said. Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.

He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together. REUTER

aVOFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY\u000a\u000aThe government's industry aid and protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said. The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system. "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes," he said. "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time," he said. Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season. The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said. He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.

aVCOFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL\u000a\u000aThe failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said. Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO." Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them." Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said.

aVEC MINISTERS POSTPONE TALKS ON SAVING DAIRY PACT\u000a\u000aEuropean Community (EC) farm ministers early today abandoned talks aimed at saving an agreement on cutting excessive milk production after making no progress in over 12 hours of negotiations. The ministers will resume talks at 10.00 local time in a bid to clear the way for a full-scale review of proposed reforms for other surplus sectors. Diplomats said member states were unable to settle differences over new rules limiting farmers' automatic right to sell unwanted butter at high guaranteed prices into EC cold stores. West Germany and Ireland are opposed to the steps. REUTER

aVEARTHQUAKES CONTINUE TO SHAKE NORTHERN NEW ZEALAND\u000a\u000aEarthquakes and aftershocks are still shaking areas of northern New Zealand following yesterday's strong tremor which left 3,000 people homeless. Four earthquakes measuring up to 4.5 on the Richter scale have hit the Bay of Plenty and Waikato region in the north-east since midnight yesterday (1200 GMT). No casualties have been reported and no further major damage, civil defence sources said. Twenty-five people were treated for bone fractures after yesterday's shock. A government seismologist said from Rotorua in the North Island some five tremors were being recorded every 10 minutes. Today's quakes were felt over an area of 100 square km, the seismologist added. A state of civil defence emergency in the area was declared yesterday and is still in force, with schools closed and access to the worst-hit towns of Edgecumbe, Whakatane and the forestry town of Kawerau severely restricted. Yesterday's quake measured 6.25 on the Richter scale. The seismologist said if the pattern of other large earthquakes was followed the shocks would continue for one to several weeks, declining in frequency and magnitude. But the chance of a further large shock could not be ruled out. Civil defence officials said major roadslips and landslides in the area are being cleared, with power and water restored to most areas. Rail lines twisted by earth movements are being repaired. Prime Minister David Lange visited the region today before flying to Auckland to attend a South Pacific Forum conference of foreign ministers. A small force of troops was moved into the area to assist civil defence workers and volunteers. Civil defence sources said people would shortly begin to return to their homes when the buildings are declared safe. REUTER

aVJAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING\u000a\u000aJapanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said. Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said. These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said. "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London. REUTER

aVJAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT\u000a\u000aJapan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. "The three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used," one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said. REUTER

aVTAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKER PLEA ON EXCHANGE RATE\u000a\u000aCentral bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. It said the Taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the South Korean won climbed only four pct. The Singapore and Hong Kong dollars remained stable against the U.S. Unit in that period, it said. Many local bankers and economists predict Taiwan's dollar will rise to between 32 and 33 per U.S. Dollar by year-end. Chang was quoted as saying this would depend on Taiwan's ability to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. This year. The surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show. Taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in January to 562 mln U.S. Dlrs from 583 mln in January 1986, the same figures show. Textiles are Taiwan's second-largest export earner, after electrical and electronic products. Textile exports surged to 7.8 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 6.2 billion in 1985.

aVU.S. ASKS JAPAN TO END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said. The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress. Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito. Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S. Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country. He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said. Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S. Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy. REUTER

aVJAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS\u000a\u000aThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness. A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters. Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said. But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak. U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement. Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement. The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure." MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said. But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd HIT.T> spokesman said. REUTER

aVBANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES\u000a\u000aThailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said. Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier. Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise. Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said. A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985. Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached. Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports. REUTER

aVNEUTRAL BUDGET EXPECTED IN SINGAPORE\u000a\u000aSingapore's Finance Minister Richard Hu is expected to announce a neutral budget tomorrow with no major tax changes for the 1987/88 year starting April 1, bankers and economists told Reuters. They said with real growth at an estimated 1.9 pct in calendar 1986, indicating signs of recovery from the 1.7 pct shrinkage in 1985, the government was likely to hold its course and wait for measures introduced in last year's budget to work. Last March Hu cut corporation tax to 33 pct from 40 pct, and income tax was reduced by the same margin. Last year the government also reduced wage costs by introducing a wage freeze and cutting employer contributions to the mandatory state savings scheme, the Central Provident Fund (CPF), to 15 pct of salaries from 25 pct. "I don't foresee any new or additional stimulus because the economy is now improving," said Clemente Escano, vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland. The government's economic report for calendar 1986, issued last week, said the CPF reduction and other cost-cutting measures only started to bite in the third quarter of 1986. But the report said over half the economy -- especially the commerce, financial, and business services sectors -- continued to be depressed by weakness in the surrounding regional economies and an excess of domestic property. The sources said the fragility of the economic recovery suggested the government would not introduce much of its planned consumption tax in the coming financial year. In last year's budget Hu said he planned to set up collecting machinery for the tax. Economists said a campaign against smoking this year might be the opportunity for him to levy the tax on tobacco as a first step towards its wider use. The sources said the government does not look likely to raise more revenue in this year's budget. Last year's budget projected a 3.22 billion dlr budget deficit for fiscal 1986/87, but the economic report projected an overall calendar 1986 surplus of three billion. Lower tax revenue was balanced by rising investment income and stringent controls on government operating expenditure, helped by the wage-freeze policy. Anthony K.P. Lee, vice-president and deputy general manager of American Express Bank Ltd, said he expected nothing exciting from this year's budget. Lee said, "It will probably be a non-event as most of the tax benefits were given last year. The economy has already started moving so it does not need government support." Last week's economic report attributed the one pct decline in domestic demand last year mainly to a sharp decline in private construction, so this sector hopes for some relief from the budget, economists said. The economic report said the sector's activity declined by 25.3 pct in calendar 1986 after a 13.9 pct contraction in 1985. A further decline is expected in 1987. But in last year's budget a 30 pct rebate on tax for industrial and commercial properties was raised to 50 pct until the end of 1988, so the most Hu is likely to do is add incentives for creating property investment unit trusts. The only measures known to be in tomorrow's budget are incentives to encourage population growth, including incentives to families who have three children. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has already announced the government will try to encourage three-child families, instead of the two-child families it encourages now. REUTER

aVFISONS SEES STRONG INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN 1986\u000a\u000aFisons Plc FISN.L> said strong international growth had been the main feature of the group's 1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50 pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period. The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct. The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985. The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from 643p. Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly indicated by a strong 1986 performance. The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full programme of capital investment. Action to protect the group against foreign currency movements resulted in a small net gain to profits. REUTER

aVPHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION\u000a\u000aThe Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters. "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies." The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at it in terms of the economy." She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead." Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing." Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984. REUTER

aVZAIRE ACCEPTS TIN-EXPORT QUOTA, ATPC SAYS\u000a\u000aZaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports, the ATPC said. ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March 1. Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes. The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year. The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire. China and Bolivia, important producers of tin, are not members. REUTER

aVJAPANESE FINANCIAL FUTURES PLAN REVEALED\u000a\u000aThe Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo. The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available, the proposal said. It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts. The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments. To make this possible, the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework. Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit, three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets. Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles, the sources said. Japan's only current financial futures market, in yen bonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985. But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April. REUTER

aVJAPAN LIKELY TO LET U.S. BANKS DEAL SECURITIES\u000a\u000aJapan looks likely to allow U.S. Banks to conduct securities business here, a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said. But the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to conflicting domestic interests. J.P.Morgan and Co JPM>, Bankers Trust New York Corp BT>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said. "There is no reason for extended delay of approval," one official at a U.S. Bank said. The four U.S. Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months. To date, Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries, this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market. But if U.S. Banks win approval, Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the U.S. Many U.S. Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June. But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment. U.S. Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months. Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June. At the last round of financial negotiations in September, U.S. Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging. Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the U.S. Request since the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers, including two Japanese brokerages, last December. They said the ministry will have to approve the U.S. Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the U.S. Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses. Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields. Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to U.S. Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan. The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market. REUTER

aVSAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES EASE\u000a\u000aSaudi riyal interbank deposit rates eased across the board in a dull market which was long in day-to-day funds, dealers said. Today's quiet market continued a lull of several days in which traders were said to be waiting on the sidelines ahead of further clues to the direction of oil prices and the Saudi economy. Dealers cited some borrowing interest in two, three, and six-month deposits but said activity focused on short dates and one-month deposits as banks tried to lend surplus funds. Spot-next was put at 5-3/4, 5-1/4 pct, down from six, 5-1/2 yesterday while one-week rates were steady at six, 5-1/2 pct. One-month deposits declined to 6-1/4, 1/8 pct from 6-1/2, 1/4 on Monday, while three months was barely changed at seven, 6-15/16 pct.

aVCURRENCY SECTORS CONTINUE TO FEATURE EUROBOND TRADE\u000a\u000aEarly dollar straight eurobond trade was quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling, continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said. Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals. The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January. The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading impetus, one dollar straight trader said. "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how anybody is going to make any money," he said. Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of the domestic equity markets. Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point. However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels. Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany. There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week. FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian -- banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt. "(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis after things had more or less quietened down following the first shock statements last week," one FRN specialist said. Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early features on the primary market. These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4 pct. The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 -- for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager. Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market. REUTER

aVPEMEX SIGNS 500 MLN DLR JAPAN LOAN FOR PIPELINE\u000a\u000aMexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said. No further details on the loan were immediately available. Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast. The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery. The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said. Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added. REUTER

aVCOMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS\u000a\u000aComalco Ltd CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said. As previously reported Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp>. Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts. The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision. REUTER

aVCRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS\u000a\u000aCRA Ltd CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER

aVCHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.\u000a\u000aChina called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said. "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs. A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin. He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status. The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be dominated or controlled by international Communism." The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them. China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said. But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added. Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT. "China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports. In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT. "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said. "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation," he said. The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system. In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance planning" and economic levers. The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do. REUTER

aVNO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY\u000a\u000aThe Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said. "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90 yesterday. REUTER

aVU.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY\u000a\u000aBritain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels. He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting. REUTER

aVCOMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELP RETURN TO PROFITS\u000a\u000aComalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed. REUTER

aVNO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY\u000a\u000aThe Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said. "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

aVGERMAN BANKS SEEK GREATER BRAZIL LINK WITH IMF\u000a\u000aWest German banks would like Brazil to work more closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with a view to seeking a solution to the country's debt problems, senior West German banking sources said. The sources, speaking ahead of a meeting later today between Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro and his West german counterpart Gerhard Stoltenberg, also believed Brazil should come up with a convincing economic recovery program. Their comments echoed those of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who met Funaro yesterday. Funaro is currently on a European trip seeking to involve governments in negotiations with commercial banks on rescheduling part of Brazil's foreign debt, which totals some 109 billion dlrs. But Lawson told Funaro Brazil had to solve its problems with the banks rather than governments. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Funaro would leave early tomorrow morning for Zurich after meeting Stoltenberg this evening. Funaro has rejected suggestions for negotiations with the IMF and said there is no question of Brazil agreeing to an austerity program with the Fund. However, the West German banking sources said institutions here felt it was particularly important that Brazil presented a credible recovery program and that there be a "rapprochement" with the IMF. "Consultations are the least that can be expected," said one banker. Funaro's trip follows the decision by Brazil 10 days ago to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. It has also frozen bank and credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth about 15 billion dlrs. One senior banker closely involved in Brazilian debt negotiation offered qualified support for a call from Funaro for a change in the structure of the advisory committee of banks which has coordinated Brazilian debt since 1982. Funaro said yesterday that U.S. Banks, holding 35 pct of Brazilian debt, were over-represented on the 14-bank advisory committee with 50 pct of the committee seats. He said Brazil might adopt a different approach to its creditor banks, involving separate discussions with the regions. Such a move would be in Brazil's interest, since European banks have been more supportive than U.S. Banks of alternative debt solutions, such as interest capitalisation. The senior banker was strongly opposed to a purely regional approach, saying: "There must be one committee and one solution." But he added: "There must be an understanding that special requests from special regions be taken into account." German banks had objected to the fact that the idea of interest capitalisation had been rejected in the committee. It was imperative that alternative options be considered. "The menu must become richer," the banker said. Banking sources said commercial banks would not be involved in today's talks with Funaro. A spokesman for the Bundesbank in Frankfurt said the central bank would also not be represented. West German banks have taken a more relaxed attitude to the Brazilian suspension of interest payments than institutions in the United States, because of their lower exposure. According to Bundesbank data from September last year, West German bank exposure to Latin America of slightly under 16 billion marks represented less than five pct of all foreign credit. REUTER

aVAQUINO ANNOUNCES LAND REFORM PLANS\u000a\u000aPresident Corazon Aquino announced government plans to devote to land reform an estimated 24 billion pesos (about one billion U.S. Dlrs) raised from the sale of failed businesses taken over by the government. Aquino said she was willing to have her family's sugar estate broken up in compliance with Philippine land reform programmes but hinted it would not be offered voluntarily. "Whatever laws will be enacted, I say that nobody is above the law and that includes me. My brothers and sisters are Filipino citizens ... We will abide by whatever laws are enacted as far as sugar land is concerned," she told reporters. A committee was now formulating guidelines for the plan, including the question of whether land operated by multinational companies should also be covered, she added. Agrarian Reform Secretary Heherson Alvarez said recently the government planned to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished farmworkers under a revised land reform programme. The plan, requiring about 1.7 billion dlrs, now also covers sugar and coconut areas, apart from rice and corn lands, he said. It was expected to benefit about three mln landless peasants, he added. Land reform pressure groups have called on Aquino to break up her family's 6,000-hectare sugar estate to demonstrate her sincerity on the issue political analysts have called one of the most pressing problems facing the Philippines. It was not known whether government would wait for the Congress to convene by mid-year to formalise the programme or have Aquino carry it out through an executive order. Under the plan, government will purchase land mainly from landowners with holdings over seven hectares. It will include vacant and untenanted farmland as well as 50,000 hectares seized from former associates of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. REUTER

aVOPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS\u000a\u000aOpec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together. REUTER

aVJAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT\u000a\u000aJapan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. Reuter

aVJAPANESE DEMAND FOR U.K. GILTS SEEN RISING\u000a\u000aJapanese investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and on calculations gilt prices will firm, bond managers said. Japanese, British and U.S. Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which have been active on the U.S. Treasury market, they said. Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said. On the other hand, major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year, traders said. These investors, who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases, appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo, a bond manager for a British securities house said. The sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from 234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year. Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply. However, gilts may benefit from further declines in U.K. Interest rates, they said. "The U.K. Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds, suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here," said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki. She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 9.5 pct, against 9.581 pct at yesterday's close in London. REUTER

aVDAIMLER OUTPUT COULD BE AFFECTED BY DISPUTE\u000a\u000aDaimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car production could fall by 150 cars a day in the foreseeable future if works councils continue to refuse to approve the firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary. A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ more workers. The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur. A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not think Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on overtime by its own works councils. A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours. The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was currently around 2,500 a day. REUTER

They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today. Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment. He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels." Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels. Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs. Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake. "It is purely coincidence," he said. But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover. Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels. Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far. Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles. "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked not to be named. Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price. Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group's associate Chinese Estates Ltd>. Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday, China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74 cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs. REUTER

aVREGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY\u000a\u000aLast week's White House shake-up has increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to the Fed say. But they said that no decision on the appointment, which must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House and Volcker too has not made up his mind. Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried often to undermine him. It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan. Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration, Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker, kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said. Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers, had been chosen to replace Volcker. But as the administration's credibility was increasingly under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about such changes was on the wane. The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the Fed chairmanship. As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share the right-wing's opposition to Volcker. "This new White House is going to need all the strength it can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of Volcker's reappointment. Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both in the United States and around the world. At a time when the stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say. U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global economic cooperation. The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation, signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming around at least partially to the Treasury position. And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman. Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983. The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a good working relationship, in part because he believed the two key government economic institutions have to work closely. Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's pre-eminent economic spokesman. He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took much more seriously. But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International. Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years. Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience -- the four sitting members were all appointed within the last three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global economy is threatened by instability. An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist would make him ideal. But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37 years old as too young for the job. Other potential candidates include economist Alan Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel. Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by his patron's departure from the White House. Reuter

aVGM GM> CUTS WAGE BOOSTS FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES\u000a\u000aGeneral Motors Corp has changed its method of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is reducing the size of the merit raise pool to 3.5 pct of the total amount available for salaries from 5.5 pct last year, a company spokesman said. He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum payments. As a result, the merit raises will not be included in the calculation of pensions and other benefits. The change affects about 109,000 salaried workers in the U.S. and Canada. GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. As a result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the base pay rates of salaried employees. The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain cost-competitive with other U.S. automakers. GM is currently in thje midst of a program to cut employment of salaried workers by 25 pct. Reuter

aVPRE-PAID LEGAL PPD> GETS I.C.H. ICH> FINANCING\u000a\u000aPre-Paid Legal Services Inc said it has signed a letter of intent under which it would receive financing from I.C.H. Corp. The company said under the proposed transaction I.C.H. would loan it up to 100 mln dlrs, and the loan balance would be convertible at any time by either party into Pre-Paid common stock at 11 dlrs per share. In addition, it said it would grant I.C.H. a five-year option to purchase new shares at the same price. It said the option would enable I.C.H. to acquire up to 500 pct plus one share of Pre-Paid common. Pre-Paid said until expiration of the option, and as long as Pre-Paid maintained a mutually agreeable combined loss and expense ratio, I.C.H. would, on Pre-Paid's request, exercise as much of the option as may be necessary to meet Pre-Paid's funding needs. The company said I.C.H. has requested the right to buy 90,909 Pre-Paid shares from Pre-Paid chairman Harland C. Stoneciphjer for 11 dlrs each. Stonecipher now owns or has the right to acquire 1,965,269 Pre-Paid shares and will agree to restrictions on the sale of his remaining shares, it said. The company saiod Stonecipher will remain chairman. Pre-Paid said the transactions are subject to approval by boards of both comnpanies and regulatory agencies. Reuter

aVNEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES\u000a\u000aEmployers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. "There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months. "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all." "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month," Schoufour said. The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest. Reuter

aVUNILEVER IMPROVES IN MOST SECTORS DURING 1986\u000a\u000aThe Unilever Plc and NV UN.A> group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement. Very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come. Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year. Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987. Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal, though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers added. REUTER

aVU.S. LEADING INDEX FELL 1.0 PCT IN JANUARY\u000a\u000aThe U.S. index of leading indicators fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said. The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December. The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct. The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment. A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline. Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance. Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock prices, new business formation, average work week and money supply. The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation. There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November. The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November. The index of lagging indicators, which measures past economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of 0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November. Reuter

aVCOFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS\u000a\u000aThis morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said. "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis. "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said. "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation," de Vries added. With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares." He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile. In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts. "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he said. "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible," he added.

Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about 45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves for inventory, receivables and excess facilities. Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in addition to the 45 mln dlr charge. Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating in technical default under its lease of transponders on the Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain agreed-upon financial ratios. It said it is in talks with the lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations. Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of transponders as a result of cross-default provisions. Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding for Contel Corp CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month period for repayment starting in December 1988. The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the Galaxy III transponder lease with Burnham Leasing> on the occurrence of certain events. Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each. Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease. It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15. Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000 dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost 9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a 1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

aVTAIWAN REJECTS TEXTILE MAKERS EXCHANGE RATE PLEA\u000a\u000aCentral bank governor Chang Chi-cheng rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Dollar to stop them losing orders to South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile Federation said. He quoted Chang as telling representatives of 19 textile associations last Saturday the government could not fix the Taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one U.S. Dollar due to U.S. Pressure for an appreciation of the local currency. The Federation asked the government on February 19 to hold the exchange rate at that level. The federation said in its request that many local textile exporters were operating without profit and would go out of business if the rate continued to fall. Reuter

Transform said its fourth quarter profit was revised to 305,082 dlrs, or two cts a share, from the previously reported 580,955 dlrs, which left the company with a fiscal 1986 loss of 249,814 dlrs, or two cts a share, instead of the reported 26,195 dlrs profit.

aVUNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986\u000a\u000aUnilever Plc UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.

The loan is convertible into an additional 229,463 DIM shares, it noted. The proposed agreement is subject to approval by the French government, it said. Reuter

The company said its international division will reach 50,000 rooms by this spring, classifying it as the eighth largest hotel chain in the world. Holiday said by the end of the year, there will be approximately 220 Holiday Inn hotels in 54 countries. The company said it plans to expand from 28 to 55 hotels in its Asia/Pacific region and to 192 in its Europe/Middle East/Africa regionby 1995. For 1987, the hotel group will focus on expansion on Western Europe and Asia, citing China as an untapped source for the international lodging industry. Holiday also said it will concentrate on city center hotels in key destination cities in Western Europe, catering primarily to business travelers. Some of those cities where Holiday said it will open new properties this year include Amsterdam, Lyon/Atlas and Lisbon. Reuter

But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said. "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. Reuter

aVU.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY SAYS EXPORT RISE NEEDED\u000a\u000aCommerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said after the release of a sharply lower January leading indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed. "The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net exports," he said in a statement after the department reported the index fell 1.0 pct in January from December, the sharpest drop since a 1.7 pct fall in July, 1984. The main reasons for the January decline after a 2.3 pct December rise were declines in building permits, new orders for plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods. Reuter

aVKENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS\u000a\u000aThe Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year," he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added. "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development," he said. "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added. REUTER

The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1 pct rise to 768,000 units from the previously reported 12.7 pct increase. The January decline in sales was the largest since last October when sales fell 9.3 pct. Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down from 59,000 in January, 1986. The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted 728,000 units. The average price was a record 127,100 dlrs, surpassing the previous record 119,100 price set in December. The median price of a home in January reached 100,700 dlrs -- the first time the price has exceeded 100,000 dlrs.

aVKODAK EK> HAS NEW DATA STORAGE, USAGE SYSTEMS\u000a\u000aEastman Kodak Co said it is introducing four information technology systems that will be led by today's highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval. The company said information management products will be the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of Kodak." Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company, Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those sales were independent, that company would rank among the top 100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out. The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's commitment to the business and industrial sector. Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the information management systems unveilded today -- -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes). - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information management system using optical disks or microfilm or both. -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current information management systems. -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based, computer-assisted system which can be a starter system. Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in 1988. Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity. Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000 in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies, including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media, fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to sell in the 700,000 dlr range. Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk version which provides data storage and retrieval through a disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing 2.6 gigabytes. Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs with deliveries beginning in mid-year. The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with the more powerful KIMS system 5000. It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987 and sell in the 150,000 dlr range. Reuter

aVBANGOR HYDRO BANG> SEEKS RATE CUT\u000a\u000aBangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a two-stage base rate reduction. Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln dlrs, or 9.7 pct. The company said lower federal income taxes and lower capital costs prompted the filing. The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct. Bangor Hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by April 1. The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1. Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some customers' rates. Reuter

aVPHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS\u000a\u000aPharmacia AB PHAB ST> forecast earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities. Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements. Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets. The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.

aVCANADA GDP RISES 3.1 PCT IN 1986\u000a\u000aCanada's real gross domestic product, seasonally adjusted, rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, the same as the growth as in the previous quarter, Statistics Canada said. That left growth for the full year at 3.1 pct, which is down from 1985's four pct increase. The rise was also slightly below the 3.3 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in February's budget. He also forecast GDP would rise 2.8 pct in 1987. Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 0.6 pct in the final three months of the year after a 1.0 pct gain in the third quarter. Business investment in plant and equipment rose 0.8 pct in the fourth quarter, partly reversing the cumulative drop of 5.8 pct in the two previous quarters. Reuter

aVEAST EUROPE WHEAT WINTERKILL POSSIBLE, ACCU SAYS\u000a\u000aWinter wheat crops in the western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said. Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning. The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures expected to fall to near 0 degrees F over the next two nights, some light winterkill is possible, Accu-Weather added. Reuter

"We would like to sell between 7,000 and 8,000 units in Europe for the year to August 1987," he told Reuters later. Officials said GM sold 1,500 vehicles in the 1986 model year.

GM sales in Europe in the 1985 model year totalled 500 vehicles, due largely to uncompetitive prices because of the then strong dollar, Fry said. All GM vehicles sold in Europe are manufactured in the United States and Canada, he said, adding that most sales were in Switzerland followed by Sweden and West Germany. Reuter

The Reagan administration proposed in trade legislation offered Congress last month that authority to monitor coffee imports be resumed. That authority lapsed in September 1986. A bill also was introduced by Rep. Frank Guarini (D-N.J.). However, the failure of the ICO talks in London to reach agreement on export quotas means the U.S. legislation is not immediately needed, one analyst said. Earlier supporters of the coffee bill hoped it could be passed by Congress quickly. "You're going to have a hard time convincing Congress (now) this is an urgent issue," the coffee analyst said.

"The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100 billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he said.

The Syrian envoy said the Israel action was a violation of the Geneva Conventions, the U.N. Charter and the "legitimacy of the economic rights endorsed by the United Nations."

aVYUGOSLAVIA WHEAT FREE OF WINTERKILL - USDA\u000a\u000aThere was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report. The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said. The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter. Reuter

aVBELGIAN MINISTER SEES NEW ACCORD ON EC OILS/FATS\u000a\u000aBelgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States. De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries. But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will be a compromise." U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and access to community markets. De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States. U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards. He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the United States. De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988. He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule. Reuter

aVDUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK\u000a\u000aLoans and advances from the Dutch central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at 12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2, the central bank weekly return showed. The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in the form of tax payments to the state. Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said. Current money market rates are at 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct for call money against 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 a week ago, and between 5-5/16 and 5-9/16 pct against 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 for one to 12 month periods, dealers said. The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added. They expect the money market shortage to continue around 12 billion guilders this week. The weekly return showed total Dutch gold and currency reserves rose 11.3 mln guilders to 56.0 billion guilders. REUTER

The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer program, von Garlem said. get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman). Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments. "The final certificate payments will be very close to 300 mln dlrs," he said. When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that "we proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it." Reuter

aVFORD CANADA FC> PROFIT DOWN ON CHANGEOVER COST\u000a\u000aFord Motor Co of Canada Ltd, 90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co F>, said the earlier reported decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant. Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product program costs, partially offset by lower engine production. The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in the prior year. Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in 1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to 18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year. The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of 4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985, excluding export sales to its U.S. parent. Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion dlrs. The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985. The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies, cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were partially offset by lower industry volumes. Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased interest costs, the company said. Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said. The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in 1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct. Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were Canada's best selling car and truck nameplates in 1986. Reuter

aVFIRESTONE FIR> TO CLOSE THREE TIRE PLANTS\u000a\u000aFirestone Tire and Rubber Co has notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire plants on or before September 15. A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company took in the fourth quarter of 1986. The company said it was notified by the union March one that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other plants. Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers for several months. Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of the three tire plants, it added. Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master agreement with the rubber workers. Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits and work rules. Union procedures, however, require approval by the Firestone section of the union's International Policy Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master contract and by the rubber workers' executive board. The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and Bloomington plants.

aVVENEZUELA PLANS NEW BORROWING WITH LIMITS\u000a\u000aVenezuela will limit new loans to 50 pct of the interest and principal it repays on its 31 billion dlr foreign debt, President Jaime Lusinchi told political leaders. Speaking last night at a new session of congress, he said last week's agreement to reschedule 21 billion dlrs in public sector foreign debt at lower interest rates reflected Venezuela's improved credit image. "Our priority is development, but I insist that there cannot be development if we don't fulfil our obligations," he said. Venezuela agreed last Friday with its 13-bank advisory committee to lower the interest margin to 7/8 pct over libor from 1-1/8 and reduce amortisations in the next three years to 1.35 billion dlrs from 3.35 billion. "The important thing is that this rate of 7/8 pct is a marker for new negotiations and will save us 50 mln dlrs this year," Lusinchi said. He said the country had been loyal to the principles of the Cartagena group of Latin American debtors but had "decided to reach an agreement convinced that Venezuela is a specal case, because of the vulnerability of its economy." Venezuela signed a 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord in February, 1986, but immediately sought new terms because of falling oil income, which dropped 40 pct last year. Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters he hopes to sign the new rescheduling accord early in the second quarter, but that in any case it would become effective from April 1. Azpurua said Venezuela's 450 or so creditor banks have been contacted with details of the new agreement, and that Public Finances Director Jorge Marcano may visit financial centres to round up support. Azpurua said that among the details still to be finalised were the exact timetable for reprogrammed payments and the outlines of a government plan to allow public and private sector debt capitalisation. He said banks had shown willingness to consider new loans to Venezuela, a fundamental achievement in the new accord. "Substantial progress has been made in talks and we will now have to define more precisely what projects can be financed from foreign borrowing," he said, adding that loans for steel and aluminium and iron ore sectors could be the first to materialise.

Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.

Under terms of the proposed transaction, each Pizza Inn share can be exchanged for either three dlrs in cash plus the lesser of 1.4 shares of Pantera's common stock or 11.50 dlrs market value of Pantera's stock, or four dlrs in cash plus a unit consisting of one share of Pantera's stock and a non-transferrable right to receive up to 0.55 share of Pantera's stock under certain conditions, it said.

aVNIGERIA, GUINEA SET UP IRON ORE FIRM WITH LIBERIA\u000a\u000aNigeria and Guinea agreed to set up a new company with Liberia to carry out the 14-year-old Mifergui-Nimba iron ore project, an official communique said. The communique was issued after two days of talks here between Guinean natural resources minister Ousmane Sylla and Nigerian minister of mines and power Bunu Sheriff Musa. Originally, Guinea held 50 pct in the project and Nigeria 16.2 pct with firms from several other countries also involved, but the project ran into problems over funding and the slump in world iron ore markets. Musa said Liberia was invited to join and its share will be decided after a project feasibility study. This would be completed in May after which finance will be sought. Officials said the study will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank, which is also expected to give financial support. Production, originally estimated at 15 mln tonnes a year, will be 12 mln initially and is expected to begin in early 1990. On an agreement between the two countries to prospect for uranium in Guinea, the communique said Musa and Sylla agreed that because of poor market conditions, it would be extended to cover exploration for gold, diamonds, cobalt, nickel and silver.

The World Bank last year criticised Uganda's policies on deficit financing and exchange and interest rates, issues likely to dominate talks on the government's proposed recovery program. Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said last month that most of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating industries, repairing and maintaining roads and buying tractors and other agricultural needs.

aVLONDON OPTIONS MARKET SEES CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH\u000a\u000aThe London Stock Exchange's traded options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year, and will more than double the range of options available by the end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain said. He told a news conference that more options contracts were traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's existence. Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from 19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth was expected. "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of 1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index. Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc PLYL.L> from March 19. The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present. Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate the London options market's leading position in Europe, especially important with French and Swiss equity options trading planned to start this year. "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least the next year. He said much of the recent growth in options had come from inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But now the retail options market was beginning to take off. The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading. Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987. The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the options market would need more than half of the available space. REUTER

aVROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS\u000a\u000aRoyal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods. "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter

aVBELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL\u000a\u000aBelgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could react was to retaliate. De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe." And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods. Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners. A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal. De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems." He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes on a lot of American products." He said "it would be stupid. We have to avoid that." He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted shipments of Asian textiles. De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West." He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines. "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers," De Croo said. reuter

aVROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year. In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year. But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods. "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness," Rostenkowski said. "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market," he added. However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States. Reuter

aVWALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC AAC>\u000a\u000aAnacomp Inc, one of the most actively traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a micrographics company. Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier. Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp GD>. "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half." Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said. A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986. Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added. Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share. In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts a share. Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said. Reuter

aVU.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\u000a\u000aExport Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at." "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients. He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list. REUTER

aVOILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87\u000a\u000aVisible stocks of 17 oils and fats are probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October 1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier. Its survey covered 13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun, rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and castor -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil, lard and tallow/greases. Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987, compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons. It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non-food purposes, it said. World consumption could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand. Oil World said it did not expect the European Community (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption. Reuter

aVCOLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL\u000a\u000aCoffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said. "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein," Cardenas said.

aVTENDER LOVING TLCI>, STAFF STAF> EXTEND PACT\u000a\u000aTender Loving Care Health Care Services Inc said it and Staff Buildiers Inc have extended the term of their merger agreement until May 31. Tender Loving Care also said Norrell Corp> agreed not to acquire any additional Staff Builders shares until September 30, adding Norrell was paid 750,000 dlrs for the standstill arrangement. Tender Loving Care said it agreed to buy the 610,000 Staff Builders common held by Norrell, about 19.1 pct of those outstanding, for 6,950,000 dlrs immediately prior to the consummation of the merger. Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for each Staff Builders share outstanding. As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22. Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include 1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred. Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue to solicit proxies for approval of the merger. Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after the record date for the meeting. In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of the merger. Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the outstanding shares will be required to approve the merger, Tender Loving Care said. Reuter

aVTALKING POINT/AUTO SUPPLIER STOCKS\u000a\u000aThe 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers. But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and replacement parts. Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's intensified competition and the large volume of production in North America planned by Japanese automakers. But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big Three - General Motors Corp GM>, Ford Motor Co F> and Chrysler Corp C>. Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and somewhat less so on Chrysler. And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable parts-making businesses. more

aVSOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987\u000a\u000aSoviet imports of soymeal may reach or exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year, the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal. At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986. The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward, it said. Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn. It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had been bought recently by the Soviet Union. Reuter

aVROSTENKOWSKI RELUCTANT TO BACK TAX HIKE\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support. He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget. However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged. There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year. Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases. On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection. "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide," he said. This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year. Reuter

aVAMR AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY\u000a\u000aThe deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co BA> and Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said. "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and Co. "They're called walkaway leases." AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft, which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers. AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its service in the Caribbean and to Europe. But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases. The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman Robert Crandall. "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms," Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the financing is provided by the manufacturers. A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said. Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet, long-range A300-600 planes. A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements. Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of planes, but not to this extent. Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into the early 1990s," he said. "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to reduce their exposure to risk, he added. Reuter

The IMF said that Jamaica had a shortfall in the year ended September 1986 due to reduced sales of Bauxite, alummina and travel expenditures. After some deterioration, the situation and prospects for Jamaica improved substantially in 1986 and early 1987, mainly as a result of a decline in energy prices and interest rates, and a strong recovery in the tourist sector, the IMF said.

aVHEWLETT-PACKARD HWP> UNVEILS NEW PRODUCTS\u000a\u000aHewlett Packard Co said it unveiled the HP LaserJet Series II printer, the next generation of its laser printer line. The company said the HP LaserJet II offers more capabilities than earlier models, but at 2,495 dlrs, costs 500 dlrs less than previous machines. The LaserJet II prints eight pages a minute and can be used for desktop publishing, word processing, and spreadsheet and graphics printing. It also said it introduced a larger laser printer to accommodate numerous workstations and a machine used to scan documents. The company also said it introduced the HP LaserJet 2000, its first printer designed to be used with personal computer networks, departmental systems and minicomputers. It can print 20 pages a minute, and has an entry price of 19,995 dlrs. It also unveiled the SP ScanJet, a flatbed desktop device that scans printed images of text. The scanner works like a photocopier storing the copied images on a hard disk, the company said. It costs 1,495 dlrs. Hewlett Packard also said it brought out a new family of plotter machines, the HP Draftmasters I and II. The new models replace the HP 758X series of drafting-plotter line machines used for computer aided design. The Draftmaster costs 9,900 dlrs, and the Draftsmaster II, 11,900 dlrs. A smaller plotter, called the DraftPro, was priced at 5,400 dlrs. It is designed for use with a personal computer. Reuter

aVPERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS\u000a\u000aRecent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said. Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986. A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected. Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation. Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts. He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO. He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members. Reuter

aVGAO SAYS FSLIC SHOWS DEFICIT, NEEDS FUNDS\u000a\u000aThe Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential liability from insolvent savings associations, the General Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing. "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near future," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said. "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLIC would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end of 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations that continue to operate," Wolf said. He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize FSLIC. Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were insolvent. He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable, earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period. The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress. Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said are considered "hopelessly insolvent".

aVGE GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER\u000a\u000aOne of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said. Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines. "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co BA> and 25 Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft. But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy. From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said. GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted. And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said. GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one order will have much of an effect on the stock." Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order "will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE. Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991. Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates. The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments. Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas. Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates. Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition." Reuter

aVKODAK EK> CONTINUES DRIVE INTO NEW MARKETS\u000a\u000aEastman Kodak Co, best known for its cameras and film products, took several steps today to boost its image as a diversified information systems company. The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast computerized libraries of documents and pictures. Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line. Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J. Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business imaging systems division. While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business products will exceed four billion dlrs this year. "We're launching a major attack on these new markets," Greco said. "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman. But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a profit," he said. Kodak also announced the first commerically available 14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store the equivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers. Reuter

aVF.W. WOOLWORTH'S Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT\u000a\u000aThe specialty retailing area continues to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct. It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago. Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion. For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs. Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits. He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said. Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States. Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth, said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings." Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period. Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada. In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores. Reuter

aVTREASURY'S MULFORD BACKS DEBT CONVERSIONS\u000a\u000aAssistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease their debt burden. "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with measures to encourage new equity investment and the repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee on International Development Institutions. Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions for lending. "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said. He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt, create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

aVCANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY\u000a\u000aCanadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said. "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd. Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct. In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter. "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia. Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number." "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she added. The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand 2.8 pct this year. Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range. Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs. "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the federal agency said in a statement. The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985. But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year. Reuter

aVBANK OF ENGLAND PROPOSES LIMITS ON UNDERWRITERS\u000a\u000aThe Bank of England proposed that banks in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets. In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they lead manage. The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said. The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead managing eurobond issues. However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of England is concerned about intense competition for market share which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to imprudent credit risk. Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters act prudently. "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market concerned...," the Bank's proposal said. Once a firm has received permission to act as lead underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60 pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of capital. The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of 28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be assessed at their full face value. The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities, revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said. The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer. The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the supervision of financial institutions. It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act, aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing with banks. The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors. Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10 and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed. However, preliminary consultations with bank representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be flawed, it said. Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a case-by-case basis rather than along general lines. Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other units of their own group of companies, the paper showed. They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to local governments and other public sector entities, and of exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks. Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed. Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their own group of companies would usually be looked into on a case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said. The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees. It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department would probably not qualify for such treatment. On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling could be exceeded in individual cases. But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said. On collateral security, it said this "should normally only be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base." "The presence of security taken on its own will be considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

aVREAGAN SAYS U.S. TO OFFER MISSILE TREATY\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan said the United States would offer a draft treaty on medium-range missile reductions at talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva tomorrow. Reagan also said in a brief televised appearance in the White House briefing room that he was summoning Ambassador Max Kampelman and the other top U.S. arms negotiators home for consultations later this week. He said they will then return to Geneva for detailed negotiations on the arms pact. Welcoming Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's offer Saturday to proceed with a treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear forces (INF) separate from strategic and space weapons, Reagan said: "This removes a serious obstacle to progress towards INF reductions." "To seize this new opportunity I have instructed our negotiators to begin presentation of our draft INF treaty text at Geneva tomoorrow," Reagan said. He said he wanted to stress that of the issues remaining to be resolved in the negotiations on medium-range U.S. and Soviet missiles, "none is more important than verification ... Any agreement must be effectively verifiable." The United States has been working closely with allies and friends in Europe and Asia to develop a proposed treaty on reducing these weapons with an eye to their eventual elimination, the president said. He said the treaty draft followed the formula he agreed upon with Gorbachev at their summit meeting last October in Reykjavik, Iceland, which was shelved when the Soviet leader insisted on linking approval of such a pact to agreement on long-range strategic missiles and anti-missile defense. "I remain firmly committed to these objectives," he said. He said Gorbachev's new offer Saturday ending the linkage of the three areas of negotiations removed a major barrier to agreement and was consistent with the Soviet position at the earlier Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Geneva in November 1985.

In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives, Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm to the companies they target. "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a country ... can base a future on." Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British industrialist Sir James Goldsmith. But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price, Mercer said. The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs, giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over two billion dlrs. In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved, sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its payroll by 10 pct, he said. Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile takeovers have also hurt workers. Reuter

aVSOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE\u000a\u000aSoviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half," Martell said. Reuter

aVOIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT\u000a\u000aCrude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said. "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added. Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december. The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week. The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said. "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales," Margoshes said. He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales. Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts. Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart. Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally." He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions. Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market. Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments. North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr. OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions. Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level. "The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result," Margoshes said. Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount. But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short. Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

aVCOFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS\u000a\u000aCoffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it is time to go and sell coffee." But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said. Reuter

GM also said it is considering offering an odd-lot repurchase program for its class H stock by mid-year. GM said the class E and H repurchases would increase participation in the net income of its Electronic Data Systems Corp GME> and Hughes Electronic Corp GMH> subsidiaries by holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common. GM also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending, excluding EDS and Hughes Aircraft Co, to 7.9 billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6 billion dlrs in 1986. It also said improvements in operating performance are expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990. "We have one overriding objective--to position GM so that it is producing the best products available in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," said Chairman Roger B. Smith. GM had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class E and 66.6 mln shares of class H outstanding at year end 1986. GM said that its par value holders currently participate in the 56 pct of the earnings of EDS and 67 pct of Hughes' earnings. GM also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all three classes of its common in connection with ongoing requirements of various benefit plans. That buyback, it said, will involve about nine mln shares of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class E and H common in 1987.

aVU.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected developing countries, committee staff said. The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said. The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs -- PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries. The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates. The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria. Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco. Other countries could be added to the list. Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow. Reuter

aVU.S. OFFICIALS SAY BRAZIL SHOULD DEAL WITH BANKS\u000a\u000aThe U.S. is sticking for the moment to its policy that Brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debt payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and not with governments, U.S. officials said. "I don't see any desire here to scurry around and help Brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to do," a senior administration official stated. "Brazil has to do business through the banks at this point," said another official following an assessment of that country's latest debt crisis. The official, who asked that his name not be used, said the National Security Council, the Treasury and State departments and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation. In a related development, small regional banks that have made loans to Brazil and other heavily-indebted Latin American countries, will meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker here tomorrow. Brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems. Brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service its debt. The official said the interagency meeting was called to discuss "the general debt situation and compare notes on (Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro." Funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political discussion with industrialized nations on Brazil's debt problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from official sources, held discussions here on Friday with Volcker, Treasury Secretary James Baker and other officials. Another senior administration official said he was perplexed by Funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when Brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines. "We are not clear at all on his tactics. To me it seems bizarre, just bizarre," the official said. One official today described Funaro's argument as "nonsense," and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to Brazil, for which that country was in arrears. Funaro has said Brazil acted to protect its reserves but wanted to avoid a confrontation. The consensus among administration officials seems to be that Brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic economic problems. "Brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their economic policy," a senior official added. Several of the regional banks that will meet with Volcker tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at the Fed's suggestion. "Since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they want to say something," one regional bank official said. But other banking sources said that regional banks, many of which are refusing to continue lending to Latin America, are dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as Citibank, in the refinancing of foreign debts. The sources added that Volcker, for his part, is dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest rate concessions to Brazil and other Latin American debtors, and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve role in the rescheduling process.

aVFCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA\u000a\u000aTotal supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date. The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury. Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier. The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm. In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm. During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said. Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened, the department said. Reuter

aVSECURITIES TAX WOULD NEED WHITE HOUSE SUPPORT\u000a\u000aHouse Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions, before considering the issue, a staff member said. In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday as a possible way to cut the federal deficit. The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax. However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place. Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17 billion dlrs a year, the aide said. The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities transactions." NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement, "Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide and would be counter-productive, making America's securities industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time when financial markets are becoming increasingly international."

aVU.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS\u000a\u000aEligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate. Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate. The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said. The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said. Reuter

aVPENNZOIL PZL> SAYS IT HAS MADE SETTLEMENT OFFERS\u000a\u000aPennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtke said the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc TX> to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and that a settlement was "in the best interests of both companies." Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders, said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling the case. "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before and after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in the letter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make such clearly untrue statements." Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the total amount back above 10 billion dlrs. Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit. "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers, Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter. "In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not accept." The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made by either Pennzoil or Texaco. "If and when Texaco's management changes its position and demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to cooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, is clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and directors." Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and profits from those assets that have since been sold "approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion dlrs for Getty. Reuter

aVHILTON HOTELS HLT> GIVEN RIGHT TO SUE IRS\u000a\u000aHilton Hotels Corp said it received approval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks. That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up by the late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp, worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hilton attorneys. Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase those 6,782,000 shares, the company said. However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the Hilton Corp. That act said that a private foundation could not own more than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over that figure had to be sold. The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will, Barron had the option to buy the seven pct, according to the Hilton lawyers. Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax law, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block of stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron was attempting to keep the large block from going public, leaving the family in control of the corporation. Reuter

aVAUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA\u000a\u000aThe Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said. Reuter

aVITT ITT> CONSIDERING STOCK REPURCHASE\u000a\u000aITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told a meeting of analysts that the company has been considering a repurchase of some shares. "We are considering that as a very important way to increase earnings per share," Araskog said and noted the aim was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market. ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share a year ago. Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares being studied for repurchase. "We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988," Araskog told the analysts. "We have more confidence...than any other time in our history - at least with me." Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s. Last year, the company transferred its European telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie Generale d'Electricite, called Alcatel N.V. ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture. Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year, Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small companies was recently concluded. "We really wrapped everything up," he said adding that the company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock transfers. Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany receiveables, which should be paid by the end of March. Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was considering repurchasing some shares, but a spokesman noted that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of the sharp appreciation in its stock price. Breaking out operating earnings by divisions, ITT said diversified services, which consists of insurance, financial services, communications and hotels, saw the sharpest rise in operating income, to 454 mln dlrs, from 297 mln dlrs a year ago. Industrial and defense operating income declined 48 mln dlrs, to 315 mln dlrs, while natural resources increased 10 mln dlrs, to 73 mln dlrs, the company said. Reuter

aVSAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION\u000a\u000aSaudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer. Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong. "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said. "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said. In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output. Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993. Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil. Reuter

aVEC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA\u000a\u000aThe European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

aVPORK CHECKOFF REFUNDS LESS THAN EXPECTED\u000a\u000aThe National Pork Board announced at the American Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refunds under the legislative checkoff program are running less than expected. The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds from the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farm bill. Virgil Rosendale, a pork producer from Illinois and chairman of the National Pork Board, said over 2.2 mln dlrs was collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct, considerably less than expected. "We believe that this indicates good producer support for the new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets, from packers and from dealers," Rosendale said. Reuter

aVSOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA\u000a\u000aDespite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year. The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said. Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan. But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said. Reuter

aVCBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS\u000a\u000aChicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said. Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

aVU.S. CONGRESS TO LOOK AT SOIL PROGRAM EXEMPTIONS\u000a\u000aThe Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops, committee staff said. Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years. Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops.

aVGM GM> BUYBACK SEEN CALMING SHAREHOLDERS\u000a\u000aWall Street analysts said a share repurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year. "He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analyst Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm of criticism from people on the institutional side." Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the shares in the near term but some had reservations about the long term effects of the plan. "They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by the buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor Co's F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis than that of Chrysler Corp C>. Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy back stock on a large scale. The General Motors plan, announced after a board of directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20 pct of the common stock by the end of 1990. The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln class E GME> and class H GMH> shares. GM shares closed at 75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78. "The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," said Ronald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities. "I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming from unless they borrow," Glantz said. "Their credit rating is going to fall." GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive capital spending. Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has 37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will be seen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said. "GM must be challenging the union to make it the strike target." Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think the overall plan was "prudent." "Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in the stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said. He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels "they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the confines of their cash flow." Phillippi, who has been telling clients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance "we've got to feel they're doing something constructive." Reuter

aVROCKWELL ROK> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987\u000a\u000aRockwell International Corp continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results, despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters. Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago. Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market. "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit. Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis. Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance. He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation. "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term, we have a very serious problem." In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S. Reuter

aVREAGAN SEEKS MORE AID FOR CENTRAL AMERICA\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan, seeking to salvage his Central America policy from the Iran arms scandal, said a major U.S. economic program for the region was working but needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned. In a report to Congress, he called for immediate approval of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four Central American democracies and eventual full-funding of a total economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992. The report, mandated by Congress, explains how the administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the Reagan-appointed Kissinger Commission, which in 1984 developed a blueprint for U.S. policy in the region that was meant to offset Reagan's military aid program for Nicaraguan rebels. The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989. "The Soviet Union and its allies have provided the Sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid to keep Nicaragua's failed economy afloat," Reagan said. Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, who briefed reporters, said the administration will not try to link approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with the vastly more popular economic package for the region, as some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested. He also expressed optimism that despite the Iran-contra scandal, Congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr allotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fighting Managua's leftist Sandinista government. Abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest fight in the Democratic-controlled House, but said he believed a majority of the Senate -- led by Democrats for the first time in six years -- would back the military request.

aVSWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT\u000a\u000aThe International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's co-chairman. The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation," Japsper said. Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a "level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules. He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he said. REUTER

aVANDRIESSEN HAILS EC MILK PACT, PROMISES FARM AID\u000a\u000aEuropean Community Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses. "We are now in a favourable position to improve the situation in the dairy sector," he told a news conference. The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of butter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new stocks from accruing. A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in December, but approval was held up by a row over Commission proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus stocks into store. After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed rules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public stocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores. Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for cuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming season. The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay compensation to those who opt for less intensive production methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections had forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years. He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older farmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out of agricultural production or passing it to successors. The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports to hard-pressed small farmers.

aVU.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES\u000a\u000aA total 60,500 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 43.147 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said. Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 43,500 tonnes, in the Netherlands 12,000, in Denmark 4,000 and in West Germany 1,000 tonnes.

aVITALIAN TREASURY TO ISSUE NEW CERTIFICATES\u000a\u000aThe Italian treasury said it will issue 3,000 billion lire of a new type of indexed government paper, discount certificates (CTS), on March 18. Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria said at a news conference the new certificates will be heavily discounted and aimed at small investors rather than institutions. The Treasury said in a statement the annual yield of the seven-year certificates will be indexed to 50 pct of the annual yield of 12-month treasury bills. Effective annual yield after tax for the first CTS issue will be 9.66 pct. "The launch of the new certificate has to be viewed in the framework of the management of the public debt as a step towards the return of a larger volume of fixed-rate issues," the Treasury said. The Treasury said future CTS issues likely would be certificates longer than seven years. CTS automatically offers a portfolio diversification between fixed-rate and variable-rate investments.

aVGREECE PLANS TO REDUCE 1987 FOREIGN BORROWING\u000a\u000aGreece aims to reduce foreign borrowing to 1.6 or 1.7 billion dlrs this year from 2.6 billion in 1986, and will use some of the funds to make early debt servicing payments, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Dimitris Halikias, said. He told reporters this year's borrowing forecast exceeded immediate needs, but Greece wanted to take advantage of low international interest rates in order to make servicing payments at a lower cost. Greece's foreign debts totalled 16.8 billion dlrs at end-1986, up from 15.2 billion at end-1985, Halikias said. He said the extra funds available to Greece this year will go towards servicing debts falling due after 1990. He did not give figures. He said Greece was able to cut borrowing because a two-year austerity program it adopted in October, 1985 cut its current account deficit to 1.75 billion dlrs last year from a record 3.3 billion in 1985. Halikias said he was "fairly optimistic" Greece would reach a current account deficit target of 1.25 billion dlrs this year. He said domestic demand has fallen, reducing the need for imports, while Greek exports are becoming more competitive. Economy Ministry figures show exports rose to 4.9 billion dlrs in the first 11 months of 1986 from 4.1 billion in the same. 1985 period, while imports dipped to 10.2 billio dlrs from 11.4 billion.

aVB.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY\u000a\u000aBritish Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs. Reuter

The department revised December factory orders upward to an increase of 1.6 pct from 1.2 pct. The new orders decline in January was concentrated in durable goods, where orders fell 7.4 billion dlrs, or 6.7 pct, to 103 billion dlrs. The department had estimated on February 26 that January durable goods orders fell 7.5 pct. Orders for non-durables in January fell 700 mln dlrs, or 0.8 pct, to 91.5 billion dlrs. These figures compared with a December increase in durables orders of 1.5 pct and a 1.7 pct rise in non-durables. Defense orders rose 2.2 billion dlrs, or 49.7 pct, in January after falling 57.7 pct in December, the department said. Orders for non-defense capital goods fell 17 pct in January after increasing by 5.7 pct in December. Within major industry categories, orders declines were widespread, the department said. Electrical machinery orders fell 19.8 pct, or 3.6 billion dlrs, after a 9.5 pct increase in December.

Revenues in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985. Williams also said the previously announced sale of its Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week. The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January. In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2 mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs. Williams said the charges in the current year were related to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook for future stability and growth in earnings. Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.

aVVENEZUELA SETS FOREIGN DEBT TARGETS\u000a\u000aVenezuela plans to have a public sector foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the present government of President Jaime Lusinchi ends its term, public finances director Jorge Marcano said. He said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable amount which will assist in development plans. The government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8 pct over London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) from 1-1/8 pct. In an interview with El Universal newspaper, Marcano said he thought U.S. Government pressure on banks had more to do with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than Brazil's decision to suspend interest payments. "I think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the U.S. Government, which urged several major banks to soften their position in various debt renegotiations. The Brazil announcement came later," he said. Bankers noted Citibank had held up an agreement with Chile, objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. A pact with Chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before Venezuela's. Marcano said a telex sent to Venezuela's 450 creditors seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans, which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. "We cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new agreement and present the financing programmes we have," he said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s. Lusinchi said on Monday the government will limit foreign borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next two years. According to the restructured accord, this would work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs. REUTER

"At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing on corporate takeovers. "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and investment banking," Proxmire said. He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman David Roderick said.

aVSPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE\u000a\u000aSpain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said. "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he said. "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure," he said. The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs. Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted. Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant. The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year. Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985. He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said. He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets. "They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad." REUTER

In its bluntest ever warning about the state of EC finances, it said "The Community is at present faced with a budgetary situation which can only be characterised as being on the brink of bankruptcy." The report, dated Saturday, is meant to set the scene for a major change in the way the EC is financed, which foreign ministers are due to start debating next month. The Commission blamed the EC's new cash crisis on the "considerable reluctance" of governments to pay for decisions they themselves have taken. "Budgetary practices have emerged which fictitiously disguise the real impact of expenditure decisions," it said. Adding that such practices were unacceptable. It put the EC's accumulated liabilities at the end of last year at 12.2 billion European Currency Units and estimated these would rise by a further five billion Ecus this year. REUTER

The company also said it is introducing three new mid-range VAX systems. Digital stated the moves "further strengthened its leadership position in the computer industry." The company said it also adjusted prices acrossall product lines to more accurately reflect performance and customer value. Digital said the new products -- the VAX 8250, VAX 8350 and VZX 8530 systems -- replace earlier models and provide up to 40 pct increased performance. It said the new "systems reflect Digital's ability to sustain its present leadership in integrated, networked systems." Effective today, the company said, it is adopting new business practices to remain responsive to the needs of customers and the rapidly changing marketplace, specifically the trend towards distributed, networked operations. Digital said it is instituting a discount structure based on total enterprise purchase of hardware and software. Purchases for resale are included within this simplified Discount structure. The company said it now has a one-year warranty on all hardware, including VAX and PDP systems, all options and peripherals. In addition, customers can select to extend their hardware warranties up to three years at the time of purchase. Digital said its new software licensing policy simplifies the transfer of software within a company and includes rellicensing procedures for used equipment. Digital said it has instituted uniform quantity pricing on all product list prices with increases to reflect full system value on high functionality systems and software. Without providing any details, it also said the are price reductions of up to 50 pct on selected memories and disks.

He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering opening a branch in London. Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly 29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from 42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks. The group balance sheet, including for the first time VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9 billion marks, Luckey said. The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct. Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own account contributed to record operating profits. Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said. Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory. The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct. The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986, and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said. REUTER

Speaking to the President's Export Council, an industry advisory group, Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under discussion with those countries. "I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us," he said. In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters, Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover by Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer. He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing U.S. companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to acquire control of a U.S. company that does major computer business in the U.S. market.

aVPS NEW MEXICO PNM> STUDIES SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP\u000a\u000aPublic Service Co of New Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln dlrs. The utility said it advised a customer task force this is one restructuring alternative being considered for the company's electric business. The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's overall initiative in response to several goals announced by New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained. Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its reorganization concept would be to separate the company's electric utility operation into independent generation and distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted 35 mln dlr a year rate decrease. Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes "the concept may well have an application in the utility business and intend to investigate it fully." The generation company would provide projected power needs of the distribution entity under a 30-year "power security agreement" which would have a federally regulated rate structure, the company said. Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986. This holding company would be the general partner of the limited partnership, the company said. The company said its limited partnership concept was presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov. Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals. It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an alternative structure that would help reduce rates through a lower overall cost of capital. Last month the governor said "I have outlined to PNM critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may administration in achieving" adding the goals include immediate rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation of business expansion. The company told the task force the new distribution company, under the limited partnership alternative or otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state regulators. PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and transmission services. The generation company would have no retail customers. PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would also be needed by FERC. Reuter

David Murdock, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Both our food business and our real estate operations increased their earnings during the year (1986)." But, he added that Flexi-Van's 1986 results were hit by depressed daily rental rates for leased equipment caused by oversupplies. The company also reported that George Elkas, formerly executive vice president, has been named president and chief operating officer of Flexi-Van Corp, while William Burns has been named executive vice president of Flexi-Van.

The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operating as a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stg pct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were sold out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bonds started trading this morning at 20 stg pct. Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength. Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from both domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan and the U.S. Although the issue had not been designated as free of tax to residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment for the market in general had generated foreign buying. The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it was announced and dealers said that even first thing this morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable existing stocks. However, sterling's continuing firm performance had prompted interest in the tap right at the outset. The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of the major part of the price until April 27, but also conferred a substantial gearing element. This meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total purchase price was tied up initially.

About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus "corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago. Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes. Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken. "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said. Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares. The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones. Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken. Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said. Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period. Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas. Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements. Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions. "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had," one buyer said. Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem. European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further. They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages," one official said. "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said. Reuter

aVU.S. CAR MAKERS HOPE TO PROFIT FROM WEAK DOLLAR\u000a\u000aThe Geneva Motor Show, the first major car show of the year, opens tomorrow with U.S. Car makers hoping to make new inroads into European markets due to the cheap dollar, automobile executives said. Ford Motor Co F> and General Motors Corp GM> sell cars in Europe, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. GM also makes a few thousand in North American plants for European export. Now Chrysler Corp C> is saying it will begin exporting American-made vehicles before the end of this year to Europe, a market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy. Ford's European operations in Britain and West Germany manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in Europe last year -- the largest U.S. Manufacturer's share of the European market. Opel/Vauxhall, with factories in West Germany, Spain and Britain, accounted for most of GM's sales in Europe with about 1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said. James Fry of GM overseas distribution system said GM hoped for a five-fold rise this year in sales of North American-made vehicles in Europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (North American-made) units in Europe for the year to August 1987. "A low dollar makes our prices very attractive," he told Reuters. Using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million and 104 mln dlrs in turnover, Fry added. That would be a jump from 1986 when GM sold 1,500 North-American made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs. Ford has 41 factories in West Europe, which manufacture all of its cars sold on the continent. But Walter Hayes, vice president of Ford Europe, told Reuters he did not expect a large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. "We have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... Europe is inevitably a small volume market." Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to European environmental specifications cut into profit margins. But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said the weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. "After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to re-enter the European market," he said. "We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of the favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the dollar."

aVBUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM\u000a\u000aThe Bundesbank is planning changes in the system by which banks bid for funds in securities repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open market instrument, central bank officials said. Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender process to two days from three currently, enabling the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly. The changes will probably come into force in April. Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business. Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks, which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level. Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area. The change to come into force next month will allow the Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself, in a process legally comparable to direct debiting. At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday. The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28 days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or longer tender periods being necessary. For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow (Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt yesterday (Tuesday). Central bank officials and money market dealers said the shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely technical, with no direct implications for interest rates. "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter," said an official at the Hesse LZB. Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater success since their introduction in their present form two years ago, and praised their flexibility. The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact instrument even more flexible, banking economists said. By speeding up the tender process, they will make it possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks, to respond to changing money market conditions. "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," said Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger. The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest rates, he said. REUTER

aVGERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987\u000a\u000aThe cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986, when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the HWWA economic research institute said. The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report. The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987. Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier. The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17 dlrs per barrel. REUTER

aVWORLD BANK SAYS S. AMERICAN DEBTORS STILL TALKING\u000a\u000aLatin American debtor nations are still willing to negotiate on their debts, World Bank director for Latin America and the Caribbean Rainer Steckhan said. In an article published in today's Handelsblatt daily, Steckhan said despite decisions by Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Brazil to suspend some interest payments, these nations were still willing to talk constructively about their debts. "These countries are still prepared to negotiate, and the instruments of cooperation developed thus far provide the means to deal with the crisis over time," Steckhan said. Several highly indebted nations have made great efforts to meet their debt payments, especially Latin American countries, Steckhan said. Chile achieved gross national product growth of five to six pct last year and quadrupled its trade surplus from 1984, despite lower prices of key commodity exports like copper. Mexico, hit by a catastrophic earthquake and declines in world oil prices also boosted its non-oil exports by one third in 1986, the highest growth rate in its post-war history. The World Bank's annual lending to Latin America rose to 4.8 billion dlrs last year from three billion in 1984, he said. REUTER

aVFED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE\u000a\u000aThe Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations." The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Reuter

These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously. Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said.

aVEC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE\u000a\u000aThe 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this "extensification" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition." EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed. Reuter

aVNATIONAL FUEL NFG> PROPOSES ARGO REORGANIZATION\u000a\u000aNational Fuel Gas Co said it has proposed a plan of reorganization for Argo Petroleum Corp>. The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources Corp subsidiary to receive 75 pct of Argo's principal producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing Argo's debt to Seneca. The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said. National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs. National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would allow it to capitalize, together with other assets, a new company for its existing shareholders. National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing secured debt to be refinanced in an 8,875,000 dlr refinancing note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas properties. Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly owned properties. In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's existing debt, Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the venture's development costs, National Fuel Gas said. It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange for their claims against the company.

aVU.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS\u000a\u000aThe Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said. The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively." At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation," and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

aVU.S. PRESENTS MOSCOW WITH DRAFT MISSILE TREATY\u000a\u000aThe United States today handed Soviet arms negotiators a draft treaty which would eliminate all superpower medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and slash such weapons elsewhere to 100 warheads on each side. Maynard Glitman, who heads the American team discussing medium-range nuclear forces, told reporters the document, "a full treaty text," was now on the negotiating table. The proposal responds to a new Soviet offer to abolish "Euromissiles" and cut sharply medium-range nuclear forces elsewhere announced by Mikhail Gorbachev last Saturday. The developments have been described by many disarmament experts as the first real opening for a superpower accord since they resumed arms control talks in March 1985. Glitman presented the draft treaty during a one and a half hour meeting at the American diplomatic mission with the Soviet team on medium-range missiles headed by Lem Masterkov. He told reporters: "It is a complete document. It has to be because we want precision. We don't want any ambiguities." The draft called for elimination - removal and destruction - of all superpower medium-range missiles in Europe over five years and reduction elsewhere during that period to 100 atomic warheads on each side, Glitman added. In Europe, this includes 270 Soviet triple-warhead SS-20's and 316 single-warhead U.S. Pershing-2 and cruise missiles. Reuter

aVGREAT NORTHERN NEKOOSA GNN> ANNOUNCES SPLIT\u000a\u000aThe Great Northern Nekoosa Corp said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common stock split. The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's Great Southern Paper division operations. In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the company said. The company said it will propose an increase in its dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June payment. The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct higher than the current rate. The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said. As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN common stock outstanding, according to the company. Reuter

aVCONED ED> AGREES TO CUT RATES, WRITE OFF DEBITS\u000a\u000aConsolidated Edison Co of New York Inc has agreed to reduce its rates 3.1 pct next month and write-off 50 mln dlrs of deferred debits, New York Governor Mario M. Cuomo said. He told a press conference the 132.5 mln dlr reduction in annual rates, along with the removal of 50 mln dlrs in fuel charges from base rates are part of an agreement which will reduce the utility's base electric rates by about 500 mln dlrs per year over the next three years and bar any rate increases until at least April 1990. Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which must be approved by the State Public Service Commission, was negotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, Public Servcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General, the City of New York and several other parties. He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctric rate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years. As a result of an earlier stipulation, we have already had a four year freeze on Con Edison's base electric rates since March 1983," he added. Con Edison said the agreement reflects reduced federal taxes and lower interest rates. The utility said another factor includes improved economic conditions in the New York City area, which led to increased sales. It pointed out "declining fuel costs have resulted in an average 10 pct decrease in our customers' bills since 1984." Reuter

aVCOFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.\u000a\u000aFailure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by "objective criteria", U.S. officials said. Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary. Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas. At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer. Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas. He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position." However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position. "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers," said one U.S. official. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London. This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said. The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said. El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria. There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said. Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions. In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said. This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals. However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks. A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans. While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position. U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement. Reuter

aVIBM IBM> DEMONSTRATES NEW CHIP\u000a\u000aInternational Business Machines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light into electrical signals that translate into computer language. IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second. The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits. IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient in turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems to be an ideal material for the light-based computer communications expected to be widely used in the future. The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector and transistor circuitry close together. Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and distortion, it said. Reuter

aVTORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST\u000a\u000aTorrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter

aVU.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS\u000a\u000aSen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they planted. Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton. The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body. Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme. If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it.

aVGATT TO RULE ON U.S. CUSTOMS USER FEE DISPUTE\u000a\u000aThe world trade body GATT has decided to set up an arbitration panel to rule on objections by Canada and the European Community to a customs user fee imposed by the U.S. Government, a GATT spokesman said. Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) council meeting that the fee, which imposes a tax on an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, is illegal under GATT rules. U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed by the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, does not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many other countries. Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine the dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it. In another development, Hong Kong, supported by a large number of developing countries, attacked the "textile and apparel trade act of 1987" introduced in the U.S. Congress last February 19. Hong Kong representative Michael Cartland said the bill is "blatantly protectionist." He added there is "almost nothing about the bill which could be regarded as in any way consistent with either the GATT or the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA)." If the bill were to be passed by Congress, Cartland said "it would forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation of world trade in textiles." GATT's council also decided to set up a working party to study China's application for full GATT membership. The group is due to report to the next GATT council meeting on April 15. Reuter

aVTURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986\u000a\u000aTurkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said. He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year. This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful," he said. Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. "We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years," he added. His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit," he said. Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained. "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered. "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said. He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.

aVENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION\u000a\u000aDrilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said. Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said. "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects," said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity. "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's drilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said. "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs," Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled. "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year," Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation. "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels," Guerard said. Reuter

aVREAGAN DENOUNCES REPORTS OF WIFE'S ROLE\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan angrily denounced press reports that his wife, Nancy, is running the government as "despicable fiction." He said the reports had "touched a nerve." Reagan made the comments at a photo session with William Webster, his nominee as head of the Central Intelligence Agency. The president and Mrs Reagan celebrate their 35th wedding anniversary today as Reagan prepares to make an address to the nation on the Iran-contra scandal tonight. When a reporter asked about Mrs Reagan's role in government, Reagan replied: "I think this is being bandied by the press. That is fiction and I think it is despicable fiction. And a lot of people ought to be ashamed of themselves." Pressed for further comment, Reagan said, "The idea that she is involved in governmental decisions and so forth... and being a kind of a dragon lady, there is nothing to that." Reagan flatly denied that that his wife had had a role in the departure from the White House last Friday of Reagan's chief of staff, Donald Regan, as has been widely reported. Regan's successor, former senator Howard Baker, was in the room as Reagan made his comments. Reuter

Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring." The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill. A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years. "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple," Izvestia said. This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

aVARGENTINA'S CREDITORS SAID DIVIDED OVER DEBT ISSUE\u000a\u000aCentral Bank director Daniel Marx said Argentina's creditor banks were divided on the country's request for rescheduling its foreign debt. "There are difficulties (among the banks) to reach an agreement and find a unanimous decision," Marx told a local radio station in a telephone interview from New York. Argentina's great efforts to comply with obligations on its 50 billion dlr foreign debt should be met by a reduction in interest rates on the part of the creditor banks, he said. Marx is in New York with Argentina's debt negotiating team holding talks with the creditor banks' steering committee. Marx said the talks should not drag on. "If Venezuela and Mexico have concluded their negotiations, we want to end (ours) in a reasonable manner and as soon as possible," he said. Economy ministry sources said the steering committee was expected today to make a counter-proposal not unlike that made by Treasury Secretary Mario Brodersohn at the start of the talks between the two parties. Argentina is seeking a 2.15 billion dlr loan to meet four pct growth targets in 1987. It also wants lower interest rates on its foreign debt. The United States said last week it would support a 500 mln dlr bridging loan for Argentina. REUTER

Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8 to 31-1/2 Tuesday. A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has 4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go for control of the whole company. An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the rumor. The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs. A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available. Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership. Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our strategic plans," he said. That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs. An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a "decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said. Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan Stanley Inc.

aVESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC\u000a\u000aThe size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said. He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86. Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention. A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount. The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86. The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said. Reuter

aVS. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING\u000a\u000aSouth Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said. He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation. Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan. Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources." Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts." He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the U.S. He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be," considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense. Reuter

aVCANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES\u000a\u000aThe Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers. "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop." Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts. But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year. Reuter

This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15. The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors. The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries. The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market. Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate. Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks. Reuter

aVTALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS GM>\u000a\u000aGeneral Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value." However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors," he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co F> and Chrysler Corp C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds," he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM," he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important." Reuter

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL\u000a\u000aHealthy growth in corporate profits and in consumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the core, economists polled by Reuters said. Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth, they said. Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits. The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily. However, this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports. "No clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced," the central bank said. Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer. Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors. The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports. Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer. A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves. Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance, said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara. Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down wages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now. Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging. Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza. To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods. Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education, and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary. The last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age. Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited. The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less than excited at the results. Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited. The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate at only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said. Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit, official figures show. Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment. The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity. Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price inflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition. REUTER

aVU.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED\u000a\u000aThe U.K. Offshore oil industry has suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy Alick Buchanan-Smith said. The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production. He added that a report by the manpower services committee which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000. Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November. They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs. Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation. Reuter

In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said. Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February." Reuter

aVTEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS\u000a\u000aTexas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells. Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers. His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production. Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves. Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel. "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way." Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

aVCOLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE\u000a\u000aColombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986. Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter

aVPACTEL PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH\u000a\u000aPacific Telesis Group chairman Donald Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs, or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986. Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed. Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company. In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the commission, he said the figure might even be greater. The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs. Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan. "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating. Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion. "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business." However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies. He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration," he said. Reuter

The bill, which the committee is scheduled to consider tomorrow, would prohibit non-bank banks from beginning any new activities after March 5, increase the number of their locations or cross-market products or services not permissible for bank holding companies. The bill would also impose a one-year moratorium on bank securities or insurance activities. The bill would establish a financing corporation to raise 7.5 billion dlrs for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and give federal regulators more power to arrange out-of-state mergers for failed or failing banks with 500 mln dlrs or more in assets. Committee chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis, had wanted to ban all non-bank bank activities started after July 1, 1983, but opposition from other committee members forced him to revise the legislation.

aVNEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY\u000a\u000aU.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said. After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals. "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default. "The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. "What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph). Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design. "One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court," said one bank official. Reuter

aVSPEAKES SAYS HE, REAGAN MISLED PUBLIC UNWITTINGLY\u000a\u000aFormer White House spokesman Larry Speakes said he and President Reagan misled the public unintentionally on the Iran arms scandal because they themselves were misled by others. In a televised interview, Speakes was contrasting the defensive, much-criticized efforts Reagan made in early attempts to cool the scandal with the dynamic speech he expected when the president addressed the nation tonight. "When we went into those press conferences and that nationwide address in November right after the (Iran) story broke, the president did not have the proper information," Speakes said. "And that's why we were misled. And consequently, the president and I misled the public, to a certain extent." "We were badly served by the people that were involved in the Iranian crisis and running the show." Asked whom he meant, Speakes said former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane; McFarlane successor John Poindexter; and then-National Security Council aide Oliver North. Speakes said those three had prepared a false chronology of events "that misled us into thinking that we had all the facts ..." McFarlane has said that he, North and Poindexter had doctored a White House chronology to obscure and minimize Reagan's role in the arms sales. He said they did that as part of an effort to prepare the president for a November 19 news conference. Reuter

aVBANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS\u000a\u000aThe Canadian government's reduced borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report. The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed unevenly while inflation remained a major concern. Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly more through short term treasury bill financings. "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by deputy governor John Crow last month. The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was 69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984. The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange transactions. Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to five year maturities, Bouey said. Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion dlrs in March, 1986. The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the advances. Reuter

aVDYNAMICS CORP DYA> IN SETTLEMENT WITH CTS CTS>\u000a\u000aDynamics Corp of America said it has reached an agreement with CTS Corp resolving all differences between the two companies. It said as a result of the settlement, CTS's special board committee has stopped soliciting orders to purchase some or all of CTS. Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the company's 1987 annual meeting. Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the outstanding stock. Dynamics said the price of stock under the option, exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price for the stock for the five days ending March two. Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the additional title of President. Former President Robert D. Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek. Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven members for eight with the remaining four members of the current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new directors. Reuter

aVCME POSTPONES RULING ON DUAL TRADING PETITION\u000a\u000aChicago Mercantile Exchange, CME, directors have postponed action on a membership petition calling for a ban on dual trading, CME Chairman Jack Sandner told Reuters. Consideration of the petition was scheduled for a regular board meeting today, but directors first wanted the opinions of a special committee that has been studying trading conditions in the Standard and Poor's 500 futures pit for the last six months. "We didn't want to preempt the committee," Sandner said. Instead, Sandner said the board will wait for the findings of the special S and P committee, which is considering some type of restriction on dual trading in S and P 500 futures. Dual trading is the legal practice in which an exchange member can execute customer orders as well as trade for his own account. Critics maintain the practice provides an opportunity for traders to "front-run" or trade their own accounts at more favorable prices before customer orders are executed. Sandner said he expects the special committee to report its findings late next week and the board to act when those findings are presented. In response to reports that the CME board is opposed to a ban on dual trading, Sandner pointed out that the board already unanimously approved a partial ban on dual trading in S and P 500 futures at a prior meeting. The change was withheld, however, at the request of the special committee after a study was released and the committee felt the issue should be addressed more comprehensively, Sandner said. Sandner said that he personally had no aversion to a ban on dual trading and "the leadership (of the CME) is not opposed to a ban on dual trading." Last week, CME special counsel Leo Melamed said the special study committee is considering changes only for S and P 500 futures and options on futures. In addition to the dual trading issue, the committee is also expected to make recommendations on the possibility for electronic order entry and execution for S and P 500 futures and rule changes to alleviate crowded conditions in the S and P trading pit, Melamed said. Melamed said at the time that in matters where a special committee is appointed, recommendations from the committee are usually approved by the exchange board of directors. Reuter

aVRENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN\u000a\u000aProspects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview. The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," Melnikov said. "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said. Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement. "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said. Reuter

Some 2,800 workers of the plant's 3,300 hourly employees will be temporarily laid off for 18 weeks from March five through mid-July. The other 500 workers will remain at the plant in maintenance, retooling and material handling jobs. Chrysler said the 367 mln dlr expenditure is part of a 720 mln dlr development program at Belvidere. The rest of the money will be spent developing Chrysler's New York and Dodge Dynasty four-door sedans to be built at the plant. Modernization of the 22-year-old facility is part of Chrysler's five-year, 12.5 billion dlr company-wide program to bring its manufacturing operations up to current standards. Chrysler said it will increase the number of robots at Belvidere to 244 from 41. The robots will be used in welding, material handling and sealing. Chrysler will also help retrain the plant's workforce. The State of Illinois has committeed 10 mln dlrs in training funds to the project. When the plant reopens in July, Chrysler workers will have completed more than five mln classrom and on-the-job hours in retraining, the company said. The July restart will be on a single-shift basis. Second-shift production will start this fall. Reuter

aVREAGAN IRAN SPEECH SAID TO ADMIT NEED FOR CHANGE\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan, fighting to recover politically from the Iran-contra scandal, plans to acknowledge in a critical speech to the nation tonight he needs to change his ways, administration officials said. "It will be a forward-looking speech in which he will say he accepts the need for change," said an official who asked not to be identified. "I think the president wants to give his side of the story." The official said Reagan would tell the public what he is doing to set things right in the wake of last week's scorching Tower commission report on the origins of the scandal. It is not clear whether Reagan will heed the advice of many of his political allies and acknowledge that his Iran policy was wrong and he personally made some mistakes. Asked at his daily news briefing if the president would say he erred, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, "His views are intensely personal and I won't give you any advance on what he intends to say in that area." He said the speech would be 12 or 13 minutes in length and that Reagan would "look beyond the horizon to a revitalized White House that will pursue an active foreign policy." "The president will discuss the Tower board report and its recommendations. He'll focus on changes he's making in the structure of the NSC (National Security Council) and his goals for the next two years," the spokesman said. To date, Reagan has defended his decision to sell arms to Iran and conceded only there were errors in implementation. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said tonight's speech might be Reagan's last chance to repair his presidency. "It's about the ninth inning ... he has to try and set us on another course. It's hard to do that, he probably won't be able to do it," Dole told reporters. Reuter

aVMORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF\u000a\u000aCongressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef. Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea. Daub was joined by several other lawmakers. U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied "we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues. Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said. In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress, administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets."

aVU.S. DAIRY PRICE SUPPORT CUT SEEN LIKELY IN 1988\u000a\u000aThe chairman of the U.S. House subcommittee on dairy, livestock and poultry issues, Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.), said it is likely the U.S. dairy support price will be cut next year. "It looks like the price cut may take place," Stenholm said at a hearing today on dairy issues. Under the 1985 farm bill, the Agriculture Secretary can lower the U.S. milk price support to 10.60 dlrs per cwt from the current 11.35 dlrs if government purchases of dairy products are forecast to exceed five billion lbs in 1988. The U.S. Agriculture Department forecasts government purchases of dairy products will total six to seven billion lbs in fiscal 1987, but says the level of purchases beyond 1987 will depend on the production decisions of dairy farmers.

aVMORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE\u000a\u000aWhether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States. "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices," he said in an interview. Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices. "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms." "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?" he said. The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it. Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said. "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered," he said. Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels. Reuter

aVLEGISLATORS COOL TO NEW STOCK TAX IDEA\u000a\u000aKey tax and budget lawmakers Wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new securities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street and put pressure on brokerage stocks. Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target of 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues. The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5 percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year. Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said. The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan maintains his staunch opposition. "First we've got to decide whether to raise additional revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early," Rostenkowski said in a statement. He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting Tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source said. The idea was presented only as something that might or might not be valuable, he said. House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was another option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said. The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend specific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in 1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision on how the taxes will be raised. The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target. But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and there were uncertainties about the details of the tax. Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said. At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that are guaranteed to anger those who must pay. "We could just do all of them," one congressional source said of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil import fee and others. Reuter

aVAMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES\u000a\u000aThe directors of the American Farm Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations. "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill," said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation. "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced," Kleckner said. The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market. A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate. The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather. Reuter

The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a news conference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH to build an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant. Asked whether U.S. antitrust regulators might object, Charles Sporck, president of National Semiconductor Corp, said, "That is a possibility." Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest in the project but he declined to estimate how much would be sought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH would require. Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational plan ready by June 1. Then it will search for a site for the manufacturing facility and an executive to head up the consortium. The consortium could be operating by the end of the year, and the facility working in 18 months, he said. International Business Machines Corp hopes to participate in the effort, Paul Low, an IBM executive, said. He said the project suppliers of raw materials and others vital to the semiconductor industry, such as toolmakers, would be invited to participate. Sporck said no decision was made on what product would be produced, stressing that the emphasis was on developing technology and sharing that with firms which belonged to SEMATECH. Other aspects were still undecided, such as whether a Japanese firm with a facility in the United States would be allowed to participate, he said. Reuter

Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid. "We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview. Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan. But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National. National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom. Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years. Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel," Redstone said. He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month. Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will be a company expense," Redstone said. He said BankAmerica BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs. After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands. Reuter

aVBRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM\u000a\u000aA senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate." His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion." Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines." He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better." He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?" reuter

aVCHINA SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN LOWER -- USDA\u000a\u000aChina's 1986/87 sugar crop has been revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline seven pct from 1985/86. Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at 837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down five pct from the previous season, while cane output is projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.

aVUAW, AMC AMO> SET NEW LABOR TALKS\u000a\u000aThe United Auto Workers and American Motors Corp agreed to resume talks on a new labor contract for the company's threatened Kenosha, Wisc. assembly plant despite a breakdown in talks last weekend, UAW vice-president Marc Stepp said. Stepp told reporters that issues which caused the talks to break off are being discussed between the two sides and that a main table bargaining session has been scheduled Friday in Milwaukee. France's Regie Nationale des Usines Renault has a controlling stake in American Motors. Stepp said the union intends "to exert full efforts" to reach an agreement that would keep the plant in operation past 1989, when AMC has said production will end unless the UAW grants concessions on labor costs. The UAW leader said the company and the union agreed in principle in 1985 to pattern a future contract covering some 6,000 Kenosha workers after lower-cost UAW contracts covering Mazda Motor Corp's new U.S. plant in Michigan and the New United Motor plant in California operated by Toyota. Stepp said there is such deep hostility between the company and union locals in Milwaukee and Kenosha that communication between them is very difficult. But he said it is possible to reach agreement on a new contract to save the jobs of UAW members at AMC's Wisconsin operations despite the impasse. AMC has said it will resume talks, but only for 24 hours to ascertain whether the union was willing to agree to the concessions it wants. The Kenosha plant builds AMC's Renault cars and a line of Chrysler Corp C> vehicles under a contract assembly deal. Reuter

Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told Reuters in response to an inquiry. Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3 billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to implement the debt plan now under negotiation. Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following release of the plan to lenders. Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle from creditors prior to June 30. The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with cash flow generated by assets backing the loans. Annesley also said there was no change in the status of legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt. Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss franc denominated debt in default. Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a Swiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.

aVTWA TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT PIE> SITUATION\u000a\u000aTrans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir. Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin. TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price. TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines. Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena. "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon." Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals. They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers. USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock. USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares. Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont. Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target. "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming. "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim. But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load. Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer. The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements. Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock. Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal. Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement," said one executive at another major airline. But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force. The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system. Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share. Reuter

aVUSDA TRANSMITS FARM PROPOSALS TO CONGRESS\u000a\u000aThe Reagan administration officially submitted to Congress its proposals to cut back U.S. farmers' income deficiency payments, decouple planting decisions from income support levels and accelerate reductions in loan rates, Senate staff said. The recommendations, first outlined last January in President Reagan's fiscal 1988 budget blueprint, were transmitted to both houses of Congress as legislative proposals. It was not clear which lawmakers might introduce the measures. The most controversial proposal in the package would make 10 pct annual reductions in target prices for major commodities. A number of legislators have predicted the target price proposal will not move in Congress. The package also would offer the so-called 0/92 option to producers of 1987-90 crops and raise the annual permissible reduction in loan rates to 10 pct from 5 pct. Under 0/92, a producer is guaranteed at least 92 pct of his deficiency payment regardless of how much he plants. Reuter

aVYEUTTER PLANS TRADE TRIP TO CHINA THIS SUMMER\u000a\u000aU.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year. "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget. Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said. "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business," Yeutter said. "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he added. Reuter

aVRIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT\u000a\u000aThe failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said. He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected. "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year," Calmon added. Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export. "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction," he added. In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags. Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added. The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe it was higher than this. Reuter

aVU.S. CAR SALES UP 6.7 PCT IN LATE FEBRUARY\u000a\u000aSales of new cars by the U.S. auto industry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of a year ago, but industry giant General Motors Corp GM> was an exception with an eight pct drop. The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry from weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month from last year. GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months, took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28 period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the entire industry were depressed from the ending of major marketing incentive campaigns. At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co F> said its car sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp C> was up 11.3 pct. The industry leader's slide was even more marked for the full month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February, including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago. Industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars sold in the seven selling days of late February represented a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the 556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate. Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars, including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in 1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack of widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather, analysts said. GM sales vice-president C.N. "Bud" Moore said in a statement that his company's sales "began their recovery from the low point reached in January, and we expect the improvement to continue in coming months." Anne Knight, automotive analyst for Paine Webber and Co, told Reuters that GM's sales were weak, but added: "I think sales will get better in the spring." "GM may make more production cuts in view of the weak sales, but this may be a strike year so they might try to build inventories," she said. In a further effort to revive sales, GM said its Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Buick divisions would offer many of their new car lines through April 30 with discount loan packages at rates ranging from 3.9 pct for 24-month contracts to 9.9 pct for 60-month deals as an alternative to cash rebates.

aVCANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH\u000a\u000aBank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986. "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank's annual report in the House of Commons today. He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy, particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter. Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark. The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in debt plagued countries such as Brazil. "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told reporters. Reuter

aVALLIS-CHALMERS AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING\u000a\u000aAllis-Chalmers Corp said it asked lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock. The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds. Under the plan, which was presented to institutional lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company. Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in a statement. Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common. Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors, common and preferred holders,and present and former employees. Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached." The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring. "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said. Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met. Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made "at substantially reduced levels." Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling and solid materials processing. Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio. Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs. The company will also sell its fluids handling operations, which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues. Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs, or 12.27 dlrs a share. The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4 mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs. Reuter

aVFORMER TRWTRW> EMPLOYEE SAYS FIRM WAS UNETHICAL\u000a\u000aA former TRW Inc controller told a Congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in its defense contracts with the government. "It is my contention that the company called TRW is not ever vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW only pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits their financial interests," Larry Eagleye said in testimony at a House Oversight subcommittee hearing. Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor components division in Cleveland. Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did not understand why the Defense Department had taken no action against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it had substantially overcharged the government for military aircraft parts. "In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books and other problems in one of the company's divisions in Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of the federal government on various military aircraft parts," Dingell said. "For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRW inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial engine blade," Dingell said in a statement. Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against TRW last year charging the company with overcharging the government. The Justice Department later joined the suit. "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW, I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management, many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy and ethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's (1984) report to the government," he said. Reuter

aVPENTAGON DELAYS PLAN TO BUY EUROPEAN MISSILE\u000a\u000aThe U.S. Army has delayed plans to buy a European anti-aircraft missile to help protect U.S. ground forces from Soviet attack helicopters, Defense Department officials said. The Army has been considering buying some British Rapier missiles or French and German Roland missiles as a stop-gap partial replacement this year for the flawed U.S. Sgt. York Division Air Defense (DIVAD) gun which was canceled in 1985. Despite recent indications by the service that it intended to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told Reuters a final decision had been suspended because some Army officials favored a more versatile gun-missile combination. The gun-missile combination would open the competition wide to U.S. firms. "The missile option is on hold now and no decision has been made," said one of the Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified. "There is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an integrated system of our own," said another official. Army Lt. Col. Craig McNab said, however, that Ronald and Rapier "are not out of the picture by a long shot." There has been strong sentiment in the Army to reject a missile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gun and missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle. Such a move would throw the competition wide open to U.S. firms, including General Electric Co GE>, Boeing Co BA>, FMC Corp FMC> and Martin Marietta Corp ML>. But some Pentagon officials have expressed fears that an "off-the-shelf" gun-missile combination could not be fielded quickly enough. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger canceled the Sgt. York gun, made by Ford Motor Co F> Aerospace and Communications Corp, after the Pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs on the system and then decided it could not shoot down attack helicopters at the proper range. The Army later expanded the division air defense concept, announcing it would divide the system into five different components for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billion dlrs, including a missile and gun-system combination on a tracked vehicle.

aVINTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986\u000a\u000aRecord high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration between national and international markets, the OECD said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34 pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in the relative importance of the instruments used in international financing. Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined. The OECD said another striking feature of international capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries, which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing. Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing through the flotation of fixed-interest securities. This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps. Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a rapidly expanding market for euro-equities. A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger debt management policies. Growing integration with national markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on international markets. It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to traditional forms of bank lending. Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas. It said many market participants saw little scope for a further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead. It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided by the market for euro-commercial paper. "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from lower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any major advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would require a significantly broader investor base.

aVNYMEX OUTGOING CHAIRMAN SEES MAJOR CHANGES\u000a\u000aTrading in energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next five to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing chairman Michel Marks. "Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous period of transition that will last five to 10 years," Marks said, adding that volume will soar, international participation will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil companies, and speculators will grow. Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX. "The priority of the next 10 years is operational efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product development," said Marks. Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that are already planned. Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined products volume could soar to 100,000 contracts a day. Much of the increased activity will come from the international sector, according to Marks. "That's a huge growth area," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign producer countries to foreign independent operators. He said it would be difficult to develop a futures contract based on an internationally traded crude although he previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility. "Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said. Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on an international product rather than an international crude will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract. Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the major oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds, and insurance companies, Marks said. "The commodities markets have become financial markets and should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries," Marks said. He said speculators will increase their share of the energy futures markets in the coming years from the current share of about 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70 pct share.

aVSECURITIES GROUP FAVORS NEW BANK POWER FREEZE\u000a\u000aThe Securities Industry Association endorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for commercial banks. Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co, told reporters his group, which mainly represents investment banking firms, supported committee members who want the Federal Reserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bank holding companies seeking new powers. "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance pending congressional review," Gerard said. The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan associations and prohibit new nonbank banks. Gerard said the securities association had no position on nonbank banks. The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensive study before changing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates commercial and investment banking activities, Gerard said. Until the study is completed, the Fed should not act on the applications by Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said. The study was likely to show substantial benefits from continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking, he said. Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker Jim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds that invest in securities. "It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax on the saver and investor," Gerard said. In addition, a U.S. tax would drive business from the United States to other countries, he said.

aVEXCHANGE BANK EXCG> SEES BANK INDUSTRY SHAKEOUT\u000a\u000aOpportunities for medium-sized banks to compete in the face of the increasing centralization of the financial services industry may be dwindling, according to John Rau, president of the Exchange National Bank of Chicago. "We're going to see a continued shaking-out of the banking industry," Rau told Reuters after a speech to securities analysts and investment advisors. Rau said Exchange National Bank has concentrated its resources on financial services for medium-sized Chicago and Midwest businesses, asset-based lending to middle-market companies, and sales and trading of financial services. "Most commercial banks depend on relatively low cost consumer deposits for their income. We decided to move our franchise into a less susceptible niche," Rau said.

aVMOST BOLIVIAN CENTRAL BANK EMPLOYEES RESIGN\u000a\u000aabout 1,000 bolivian central bank employees, more than 80 per cent of the workforce, accepted management terms to quit today, a union leader said. "none of the employees who have decided to resign from the institution is prepared to work again in the bank, unless many of the economic and social conditions improve," bank workers leader mario galindas told reuters. The centre-right government of president victor paz estenssoro had approved a restructuring plan which envisaged at least 600 redundancies, about half the bank's workforce, in line with its policy of streamlining the state sector. Galindas said the bank needed at least 800 employees to keep up its present functions. The bank agreed to pay a 5,000 dollar bonus to every employee who resigned, as well as the legal redundancy terms of three months salary plus one for every year worked. Reuter

aVSURINAM GOVERNMENT TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC CRISIS\u000a\u000aSurinam's military government opens a four-day congress tomorrow to discuss the country's deepening economic crisis, the official Surinam News Agency reported. Acting Prime Minister Jules Wijdenbosch will open the meeting which is being attended by government officials, political leaders and heads of labor unions. Surinam's economy has suffered a sharp downturn in recent months as a result of guerrilla activities led by former soldier Ronny Brunswijk, who is seeking to overthrow the government of Commander Desi Bouterse. The guerrillas have forced the shutdown of most of Surinam's vital bauxite and aluminum industry, creating a foreign exchange crisis and food shortages. Reuter

aVIVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED\u000a\u000aIvory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said without elaborating. "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market," he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee. Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate. Reuter

Dlrs in January from 203 mln, revised from 207 mln, in December and 305 mln in January 1986, in a smoothed measurement, the Statistics Department said. Unsmoothed figures show a deficit of 162 mln dlrs for January against 107 mln, revised from 75 mln for December 1986 and 575 mln in January 1986. The smoothed series -- adjusted to iron out random fluctuations -- shows a widening surplus on merchandise trade to 46 mln from a surplus of 33 mln, revised from 43 mln dlrs in December and a 71 mln deficit in the a year ago period. Exports were 905 mln dlrs against 929 mln, revised from 971 mln in December and 816 mln a year earlier, while imports fell to 858 mln from 895 mln, revised from 928 mln in December and 888 mln in January 1986. Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 53 mln dlrs vs 141 mln, revised from 203 mln surplus in December 1986 and a 323 mln deficit a year earlier. The deficit on invisibles on unsmoothed figures eased to 215 mln dlrs from 248 mln, revised from 277 mln in December and 252 mln in January 1986.

aVCHARTS SIGNAL BULLISH BREAKOUT IN DEBT FUTURES\u000a\u000aThe rally Wednesday in U.S. interest rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a three month trading range which signals a bullish chart breakout, financial analysts said. In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts said. "The market is paying more attention to the weakened state of the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery. Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth will be slow. Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production figures also provided some support. "The domestic economies of the major trading partners of the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be forced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodative U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First Options of Chicago. Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices. "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather than translate those into their own currencies and suffer exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments," Michael said. Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from buying by Japanese interests. But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32. "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bonds close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways pattern we've been in for the last three months." Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said. Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still have the April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearby contract is 105-15/32. Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June T-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106." Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed from other technical indicators such as relative strength indexes and short-term momentum indicators. "Without them, sustained strength is in question," Keefe said. Reuter

aVPRESIDENT REAGAN SAYS ARMS FOR HOSTAGES WAS MISTAKE, ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY\u000a\u000a\u000a

aVREAGAN ADMITS IRAN ARMS OPERATION A MISTAKE\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan, fighting to regain public confidence in the wake of the Iran arms scandal, admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an arms-for-hostages deal and, "It was a mistake." "When it came to managing the NSC (National Security Council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its previous track record," Reagan said in a television address to the American people. "I have already begun correcting this," he added in his prepared remarks. Reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to last week's scorching Tower commission report on the secret sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to U.S.-backed contra rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he waited for the truth to come out and admitted, "I've paid a price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence." He said that a few months ago, he told the American people he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert operation. "My heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not," Reagan said. "There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. It was a mistake," he said. Reagan again said that the original Iran initiative was to develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a post-Khomeini government. "It's clear from the Board's report however that I let my personal concern for the hostages spill over into the geo-political strategy of reaching out to Iran. "I asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that I didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total Iran plan," he said. The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower, said Reagan's "intense compassion" for Americans being held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had resulted in an unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy. It portrayed 76-year old Reagan as a man who did not know or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal activities of his National Security Council (NSC) staff, which hatched the operation. Reagan said he endorsed all of the Tower commission's recommendations about the running of the NSC, adding, "In fact, I'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in even better order." He noted that he had appointed former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped Baker would help him forge a new partnership with Congress, "especially on foreign and national security policies." He said his new national security adviser, Frank Carlucci, was rebuilding the national security staff "with proper management discipline." Reagan said that almost half the NSC professional staff now consisted of new people. He said that FBI Director William Webster, his new nominee to head the CIA, "understands the meaning of 'rule of law'". Reagan also announced that Tower had agreed to serve as a member of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which acts as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities. But he said that he had issued a directive barring the NSC staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- "No ifs, ands, or buts." Tonight's speech was a far cry from Reagan's initial strong defense of his Iran policy. In a televised speech last November 13, Reagan called charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the U.S. war on terrorism "utterly false." As recently as two months ago in his State of the Union speech, Reagan said that "serious mistakes were made" but defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals. By contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that was a marked departure from Reagan's usual upbeat, confident demeanor. He said he took full responsibility for his own actions "and for those of my administration." "As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I am still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior," Reagan said. Reagan said the message that the nation should move on had come from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, from allies around the world -- "and if we're reading the signals right, even from the Soviets." His remark seemed to be a reference to a new Soviet willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Reuter

aVREAGAN SAYS IRAN POLICY RECORDS IMPROPERLY KEPT\u000a\u000aPresident Reagan said improper record keeping of meetings and decisions made on the Iran arms initiative led to his failure to recollect whether he approved arms shipments by Israel before or after the fact. In a televised address to the American people Reagan said he is still upset that no-one kept proper records -- a complaint made by the Tower commission. The arms shipment was made in August of 1985 by Israel. "I did approve it; I just can't specifically say when," Reagan said. Reagan added: "Rest assured, there's plenty of record-keeping now going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House)." The timing of Reagan's approval of the Israeli shipment is important because it could determine whether the sale violated various laws, including the Arms Export Control Act. Reuter

Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of 408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and New York's close of 410.00/50. Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities, they added. However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60 dlrs, dealers said. On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of 3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778 close. REUTER

aVIRAN REPORTS OFFENSIVE AS IRAQ THREATENS AIR RAIDS\u000a\u000aIranian troops are fighting on two widely separated fronts in a new offensive in the mountains of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, Tehran's IRNA news agency said. Baghdad war communiques made no mention of fresh fighting on northern or southern sectors, but a military spokesman threatened a resumption of air raids on Iranian towns. IRNA, monitored by the BBC in London, said Iran had seized several strategic heights in the northern assault, which started on Tuesday. It said at least 2,000 Iraqi troops had been killed, wounded or captured. The offensive is in the Haj Omran area of Kurdistan, scene of fierce fighting in 1983. Tehran radio reported last night that Iranian forces were in control of four mountain areas, bringing several Iraqi towns with troop concentrations within artillery range. In the south, IRNA said, Iranian forces captured several Iraqi defence posts east of Iraq's second city, Basra, in a drive north along the Shatt al-Arab waterway. Today is the end of a two-week-long Iraqi moratorium on air raids declared on condition that Iran stop attacking Iraqi territory and shelling its towns.

aVITALIAN PRESIDENT FACES PROBLEMS CHOOSING LEADER\u000a\u000aPresident Francesco Cossiga meets political leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi. Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister five times previously and whom the majority Christian Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again. The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing five-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party's president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister. Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, the Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general elections are likely unless agreement can be reached. Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists and the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats. After the consultations, Cossiga will name a prime minister-designate who will try to form a government. REUTER

aVUNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE\u000a\u000aAbnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said. It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said. The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months. The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said. The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said. REUTER

aVTAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES\u000a\u000aTaiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said. He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd JIMA.T>, he said. Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production. "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said. He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea. Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs. But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery. "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification," he said. Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87. CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said. Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright. REUTER

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - INDONESIA'S ECONOMY\u000a\u000aIndonesia heads for general elections in six weeks' time with its economy in the worst shape in 20 years, economists and officials said. The government expects no spillover of "people power" from the neighbouring Philippines to unsettle the 20-year rule of President Suharto, victory for whose ruling Golkar party in the coming parliamentary elections is assured. However, Western diplomats said it is the country's deteriorating economic position that is the main threat to its stability. Last year's collapse in oil prices dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia, halving its revenue from oil and gas exports to 6.5 billion dlrs last year from 12.4 billion in 1985. Oil and gas account for 70 pct of export income. The result is that in the run-up to April 23 elections, Suharto, far from wooing his 168 mln countrymen with pay increases or tax cuts, is busy slashing budget spending. The government has also recently increased transport fares and frozen the pay of the civil service and the army for the second year running, despite inflation now estimated at 8.8 pct. The current account deficit rose to 4.09 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1.8 billion in 1985, while the debt service ratio widened to 33.2 pct for 1987 from 25 pct in 1986. Foreign debt repayments of 4.6 billion dlrs account for almost a third of the 1987/88 budget. A recent U.S. Embassy report on the economy said 1986 gross domestic product growth was the lowest since the mid-1960s when Suharto came to power. Western economists said GDP registered nil growth or contracted last year after 1.9 pct growth in 1985, and predicted only a one pct rise this year. In its efforts to return to growth seen in the oil-boom years of the 1970s when the economy grew an average seven pct, the government is now relying more on foreign borrowings. Indonesia has asked foreign governments to finance its share of new projects being built with overseas money, because it cannot afford even to meet local costs. In the last three months Indonesia has taken out new loans totalling 1.55 billion dlrs, on top of its external debt of 37 billion dlrs. Western bankers said more will be needed, and the country now ranks sixth among Third World debtors. A 350 mln dlr commercial loan signed in Tokyo in December was followed in the first week of February with a 300 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to support the balance of payments. Last month, Japan's Export-Import Bank agreed a 900 mln dlr loan to meet Indonesia's share of 21 World Bank projects which would otherwise have been scrapped or postponed. More loans are on the way, including two more from the World Bank worth a total 300 mln dlrs for roads and irrigation. U.S. Ambassador Paul Wolfowitz said in a recent speech that economic growth remains the key to preserving Indonesia's fundamental stability. The largest Moslem nation in the world, Indonesia has so far avoided some of the more extreme paths of other Moslem countries. But the World Bank has warned that mounting unemployment could start causing severe social strains unless it is tackled. It said in its annual report on Indonesia last June that unless economic growth is revived, unemployment could reach what it termed "unacceptable levels." Unemployment was officially put at 4.8 pct at the end of last year, but those considered underemployed number around 35 pct. What path to take appears to be a matter of some dispute within Suharto's government, with his Western-trained technocrats advocating more of the classic remedies supported by the international financial community. But another group supports a protected economy, with more import substitution, the U.S. Embassy report said. The government devalued the rupiah by 31 pct against the dollar last September to help exports and curb imports, and is currently working on a series of measures to further encourage foreign investment and boost exports outside the oil sector. The direction Suharto takes could affect Indonesia's ability to raise new loans in the future, Western bankers say. So far, despite three packages of economic measures over the past nine months, he has not touched key monopolies that are linked to businesses controlled either by his family or by business associates, diplomats and bankers say. Diplomats and investors are now looking for action on monopolies and the loss-making state sector as signs that Suharto is serious about tackling the country's problems. REUTER

aVREAGAN SPEECH WINS MIXED REACTION FROM CONGRESS\u000a\u000aRepublicans in Congress hailed President Reagan's speech on the Iran arms scandal as candid and constructive while Democrats, who control both houses, said Reagan would now have to match his words with action. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (Democrat) of West Virginia said in a television interview he was heartened that Reagan had acknowledged some of his mistakes. "But one speech is not enough to rebuild trust." "President Reagan told the American people what they needed to hear, that mistakes were made and he made them," Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said. Reagan, responding to the Tower Commission report criticising his role in the Iran arms scandal, said for the first time the Iran arms policy, and not just its implementation, was a mistake and accepted responsibility for the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels. Senator Bill Bradley (Democrat) of New Jersey said the administration would "remain under a cloud" until several key figures in the scandal, including fired National Security Council (NSC) aide Oliver North and his boss Adm. John Poindexter, have told "the whole truth." Republicans and Democrats praised the appointment on Friday of former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as chief of staff, and the replacement of Poindexter with Frank Carlucci to head the NSC. Assistant House Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he believed Reagan took the right measure in admitting mistakes without apologising for them.

aVOPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO\u000a\u000aOPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand.

He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EUROYEN BOND ISSUES INCREASE\u000a\u000aThe easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency, bond managers and traders said. Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the Eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the Japanese, they said. This lack of real yen demand through the freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 U.S. And Japanese accord to internationalise the yen, they said. The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese interest rates but have no need for yen. They arrange primarily with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. More than 85 pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added. "The borrowers don't care which currency they use. They are only after attractive money," one bond trader said. Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year, boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total Eurobond market, Koichi Kimura, managing director of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, said recently. Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues. Many even resort to "harakiri" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing. But the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987, said Naoki Yokoyama, manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation. The Euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by Japanese trust banks, one trader said. After a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is strong, he added. Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments, traders said. "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen)," said Masaki Shimazu, manager of Daiwa's bond department. While few foreigners are interested in the secondary market, Japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer little currency risk, traders said. The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from 180. A ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small. "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the Euroyen market," he said. One trader said that although demand from Japanese investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. He said many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S. Interest rates decline further. To encourage further international use of the yen, the ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers. Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next few months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come. Japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory. Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be. "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps," one bond manager said. If more financial instruments were available, there might be more trades in yen, he added. Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities, traders said. The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond maturities within a few months. One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen. But freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the Japanese currency, he said. "If exporters or importers can raise funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the Japanese yen as a settlement currency," he added. The Finance Ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors. "No major market can keep its status without change," he said. REUTER

It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986. It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.

aVHK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE\u000a\u000aThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks," one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd WAIA.HK> and James Capel and Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions." Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER

aVNEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN\u000a\u000aThe highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said. REUTER

aVHAWKE SEES FOUR BILLION DLR BUDGET DEFICIT\u000a\u000aAustralian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating said the government's 1986/87 Budget deficit could hit four billion dlrs against the official forecast of 3.5 billion. Hawke told a Sydney radio station the deficit "may turn out at four billion." He and Keating last week warned that the budget deficit was running above target and vowed sharp decisions on spending in a May 14 economic statement. A four billion dollar Budget deficit would be in line with private economists' forecasts and compares with a 1985/86 shortfall of 5.73 billion dlrs. Hawke said the 1986/87 deficit would be equal to 1.5 pct of forecast Gross Domestic Product against five pct when he took office during the 1982/83 year. "In money terms (the deficit has been reduced) from the 9.6 billion dlrs that we inherited ... Down to about 3.6 billion, it may turn out at four billion dlrs," Hawke said.

aVSPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT\u000a\u000aThe Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets. In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13. "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the statement said. Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct. The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged. Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987. Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern. Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control. Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

aVJAPANESE BANKS SEEN AGREEING DEBT RISK SCHEME\u000a\u000aJapanese creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations, international financial sources told Reuters. Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month, they said. The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad, the sources said. Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project, the sources said. Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said. There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and perhaps as many as 28, they said. About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil, accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country. The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, the sources said. The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock. The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad, the sources said. The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans. Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina, they said. The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location. Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied. A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries. The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans.

aVIRAN REPORTS HEAVY FIGHTING IN IRAQI KURDISTAN\u000a\u000aIran said its troops repulsed heavy Iraqi counter-attacks and continued their advance through the rugged mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan in overnight fighting on the northern war front. Iran launched the new offensive, codenamed Karbala-7, on Tuesday night among the snow-capped peaks of the Haj Omran border area of northeast Iraq. The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the troops "continued their successful advance ... With more thrusts into enemy positions." It said "remnants of Iraqi Brigade 604 was shattered and 200 of its personnel killed or wounded." One battalion of the 25th Division's Third Brigade thrown into counter-attacks today suffered 70 pct losses, the agency added. Some 208 prisoners of war had been taken from the front. IRNA said the Iranian forces backed by heavy artillery fire were continuing to advance. No Iranian casualties were given. The area between Haj Omran and the Kurdish town of Rawandiz some 65 km inside Iraq was the scene of heavy fighting in 1983. Iran has backed dissident Kurds in the area in attacks on government positions and installations in northern Iraq. IRNA said the Iranian forces captured large amounts of munitions in the latest fighting. The Iraqis have made no comment so far on the Kurdistan fighting, or on advances Tehran reported yesterday on the southern war front east of the strategic Iraqi port of Basra. IRNA said today a group of its reporters visited newly-captured areas on the southern front and found the battlefield littered with the bodies of Iraqi soldiers and burnt military equipment. They quoted an Iranian soldier, Hamid Dehqani, as saying heavy rainfall during the past few days "had paralysed the Iraqi enemy from embarking on any action" against the attacking Iranians. IRNA referred to the "Fish Canal" -- the man-made Fish Lake -- made by the Iraqis as a defensive barrier on the eastern side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The agency yesterday said infantry and armour of the Revolutionary Guards had captured strong defences west of the canal in bitter fighting with Iraqi troops. REUTER

aVTAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH\u000a\u000aTaiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said. Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4. He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result. Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987. In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics. Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year. The reserves could support imports of more than two years for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the U.S. REUTER

aVBANK OF CEYLON TO ADOPT NEW POLICIES\u000a\u000aSri Lanka's largest bank, the government-owned Bank of Ceylon, plans to adopt a more aggressive and selective interest rate policy to reduce excess liquidity, estimated at some 500 mln rupees, and enlarge the country's export manufacturing base, the bank's new chairman Nimal Sandaratne told Reuters in an interview. The bank aims to reduce terms for prime customers and is holding talks with the Export Development Board on details to be announced later, he said. Sandaratne was head of research at the Central Bank of Ceylon, the nation's central bank, until January. A Swiss-based non-governmental group, which Sandaratne declined to identify, has agreed in principal to guarantee export credits, he said, but refused to elaborate further. The bank may also consider more actively participating in the foreign exchange markets in light of its substantial non-resident foreign currency holdings of about 473 mln rupees, or about 70 pct of the total market, he said. Sandaratne said the bank may sell 60 pct of its shares in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd. The Asian Development Bank and a foreign bank operating here have already expressed interests in acquiring a stake in MBSL, Sandaratne said. He tentatively estimated the Bank of Ceylon's net profits for calendar 1986 at 163 mln rupees up from 133 mln the previous year. The increase was eroded by increased provisions for bad debts, he said. About 50 mln was written off and 17 mln allotted for general provisions, he added. REUTER

"The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way," he said.

The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions.

aVU.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS\u000a\u000aU.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States. "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he told a press conference after three days of talks. "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth." Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year, Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986. He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport, agricultural products and car telephones. He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased, he said. REUTER

aVJAPANESE CAPITAL INVESTMENT SEEN SLUGGISH IN 1987\u000a\u000aJapanese private plant and equipment investment will grow 0.1 pct in fiscal 1987, starting April 1, from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing sector spending, the Japan Development Bank said. Capital spending by manufacturing industries, hit hard by the rise of the yen, will fall 5.6 pct, a survey said. Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust, it said. The 0.1 pct overall increase compares to the 3.1 pct rise the bank projected for the current fiscal year. In the manufacturing sector, iron and steel companies are the most pessimistic, with an estimated 18.0 pct spending cut. Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will decline by 18 pct and 11.2 pct respectively, the survey said. In the non-manufacturing sector, transport and leasing service industries are expected to increase their spending by 15.7 pct and 10.6 pct, respectively.

aVJAPAN RULING PARTY FIXES DATE OF BUDGET HEARING\u000a\u000aJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable. In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14, parliamentary officials said. The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan. Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based. A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to push through the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closely negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I would like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly." The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, is planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual income and corporate tax. The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower House plenary session, political analysts said. The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an unforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the sales tax. REUTER

aVGERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT\u000a\u000aThe outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said. The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct. In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies. "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected." The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges. They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year. West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said. However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours. The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation. It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course. The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world. Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home. The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct. REUTER

aVECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS\u000a\u000aPoland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago. Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to convert into financial terms," one banking source said. But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate. They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory. "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said. The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission. According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders. But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation." A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed. Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show. Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons. "Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy." "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality. Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges. Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry. "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now," said one Western envoy. He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry. Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently. Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs." While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said "The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity." Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States. He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners." He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt." Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role. "As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

aVU.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG\u000a\u000aBritain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show. Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln. For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984. Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday. The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion. In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg. The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said. However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available. REUTER

aVFRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY\u000a\u000aThe Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week. This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985. REUTER

aVHONG KONG CD MARKET SHUTS DOWN AFTER NEW ISSUE\u000a\u000aThe Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced, bankers said. Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue. Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all major players stopped making markets in existing issues. The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs flooded the market in January. Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed. The speculation depressed local interest rates and unleashed a flood of new issues. But the speculation faded in early February and interest rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate capital market. By late February the market had recovered considerably but Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today. Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new issue circulated. When the deal was launched the major players quickly suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own issues, brokers said. "We just don't know where the market is going," said a European banker. They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10 basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister banks in the Bank of China group. An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the market at that time. But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the present market conditionS, "the timing was just not right." "If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues now, and then the market would be all right," another dealer said. "But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic," he said. "The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals." Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the group has not yet been finalised. "Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the deal," said a dealer. "But there are other considerations such as relationship." He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager. A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new issue. "Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue," he said. Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues. REUTER

aVHUGHES TOOL HT> SEEKS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER\u000a\u000aHughes Tool Co said its board has appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker International Corp BKO>. Last night, Hughes directors said it would terminate its agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that the Hughes board had determined to be unreasonable. The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at Hughes. Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer. Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on condition that they find a buyer approved by the Department for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their agreement. Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions. Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand, Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree." The company said its board found the consent decree to be unreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed a substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of the combined company, which would have been called Baker Hughes Inc, and would include all of Reed's international assets and its coring and diamond bit assets. Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to sell Reed. The company said the board decision to adopt its own divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker did not accept was unanimous. Reuter

aVNO MINES DAMAGE REPORTED AFTER CHILE TREMOR\u000a\u000aA tremor hit northern Chile early today but there were no immediate reports of victims or of damage to the country's vital mining industry, the National Bureau for Emergencies, ONEMI, said. The effects of the tremor at 0620 hrs (0920 GMT) registered four to six degrees on the 12-degree Mercalli scale in Antofagasta, 1,000 km north of Santiago, and five to six degrees in Chuquicamata and Calama, at the centre of Chile's mining region. The tremor was followed by a milder aftershock at 0758 hrs. An ONEMI spokesman said windows had been broken and a number of cornices had fallen off buildings in the worst-hit areas. These effects are described as up to seven degrees on the Mercalli scale. The tremor caused a partial power cut in northern Chile, the spokesman added. Quoting from the latest report from the area, received at 8.37 A.M., He said the effects of the tremor registered two to three degrees on the Mercalli scale in Arica, on the northern border with Peru, and three to four in Copiapo, 700 km north of Santiago.

aVEARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING\u000a\u000aOPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

aVBAKER BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES HT> MERGER\u000a\u000aBaker International corp said it has filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co to complete its proposed merger with Baker. Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by Hughes. Hughes' board had previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures. Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice Department consent decree. Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal. Baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger. Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves. Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs or three pct. Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree. It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary damages it did not name. Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies. Reuter

The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional." USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger. The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly. USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont. "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests." USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont. The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

aVU.S. EXPANSION THREATENED - CONGRESSIONAL REPORT\u000a\u000aThe U.S. economy is facing several serious problems which threaten its continued expansion, according to a Congressional report released today. The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near future. Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation. Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee, which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives. "The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger signals that lie just below the surface," Committee chairman Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement. "A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin ice," the Maryland Democrat said. He said the danger signals included a decline in investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the nation's farmers. Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration forecasts. "The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy," the Republican report said. "The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress is reducing the federal deficit," the Republicans added. Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but also wanted the government to spend more on education, job training, research and development and health care. They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy if this becomes necessary. "There is now substantial concern about the inflationary effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money supply," the Democrat report said. "At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources of capital in American investment markets means that the Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down." "Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy is thus not very encouraging," the Democrats said. The Democrats called on the Administration to be more aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking new initiatives to solve the international debt problem. The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982. Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to increase American productivity including incentives for saving and investment in plant and equipment and development of a better educated work force.
